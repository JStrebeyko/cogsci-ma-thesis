Franklin_D._Roosevelt,"[""Franklin Delano Roosevelt[a] (January 30, 1882\xa0– April 12, 1945), also known as FDR, was the 32nd president of the United States, serving from 1933 until his death in 1945. The longest-serving U.S. president, he is the only president to have served more than two terms. His initial two terms were centered on combating the Great Depression, while his third and fourth saw him shift his focus to America's involvement in World War II."", ""A member of the prominent Delano and Roosevelt families, Roosevelt was elected to the New York State Senate from 1911 to 1913 and was then the assistant Secretary of the Navy under President Woodrow Wilson during World War I. Roosevelt was James M. Cox's running mate on the Democratic Party's ticket in the 1920 U.S. presidential election, but Cox lost to Republican nominee Warren G. Harding. In 1921, Roosevelt contracted a paralytic illness that permanently paralyzed his legs. Partly through the encouragement of his wife, Eleanor Roosevelt, he returned to public office as governor of New York from 1929 to 1933, during which he promoted programs to combat the Great Depression. In the 1932 presidential election, Roosevelt defeated president Herbert Hoover in a landslide victory."", 'During his first 100 days as president, Roosevelt spearheaded unprecedented federal legislation and directed the federal government during most of the Great Depression, implementing the New Deal, building the New Deal coalition, and realigning American politics into the Fifth Party System. He created numerous programs to provide relief to the unemployed and farmers while seeking economic recovery with the National Recovery Administration and other programs. He also instituted major regulatory reforms related to finance, communications, and labor, and presided over the end of Prohibition. In 1936, Roosevelt won a landslide reelection. He was unable to expand the Supreme Court in 1937, the same year the conservative coalition was formed to block the implementation of further New Deal programs and reforms. Major surviving programs and legislation implemented under Roosevelt include the Securities and Exchange Commission, the National Labor Relations Act, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Social Security. In 1940, he ran successfully for reelection, before the official implementation of term limits.', 'Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Roosevelt obtained a declaration of war on Japan. After Nazi Germany and Italy declared war on the U.S. on December 11, 1941, the United States Congress approved additional declarations of war in return. He worked closely with other national leaders in leading the Allies against the Axis powers. Roosevelt supervised the mobilization of the American economy to support the war effort and implemented a Europe first strategy. He also initiated the development of the first atomic bomb and worked with the other Allied leaders to lay the groundwork for the United Nations and other post-war institutions, even coining the term ""United Nations"".[2] Roosevelt won reelection in 1944 but died in 1945 after his physical health seriously and steadily declined during the war years. Since then, several of his actions have come under criticism, such as his ordering of the internment of Japanese Americans. Nonetheless, historical rankings consistently place him among the three greatest American presidents.', 'Franklin Delano Roosevelt was born on January 30, 1882, in Hyde Park, New York, to businessman James Roosevelt I and his second wife, Sara Ann Delano. His parents, who were sixth cousins,[3] came from wealthy, established New York families—the Roosevelts, the Aspinwalls and the Delanos, respectively—and resided at Springwood, a large estate south of Hyde Park\'s historic center. [4] Franklin\'s father James, was a prominent Bourbon Democrat who once took him to meet President Grover Cleveland. During this meeting, Cleveland said: ""My little man, I am making a strange wish for you. It is that you may never be President of the United States.""[5] Franklin\'s mother Sara, the dominant influence in his early years, once declared, ""My son Franklin is a Delano, not a Roosevelt at all.""[3][6] James, who was 54 when Franklin was born, was considered by some as a remote father, though biographer James MacGregor Burns indicates James interacted with his son more than was typical at the time.[7] Franklin had a half-brother, James Roosevelt ""Rosy"" Roosevelt, from his father\'s previous marriage.[4]', ""As a child, Roosevelt learned to ride, shoot, sail, and play polo, tennis, and golf.[8][9] Frequent trips to Europe—beginning at age two and from age seven to fifteen—helped Roosevelt become conversant in German and French. Except for attending public school in Germany at age nine,[10] Roosevelt was homeschooled by tutors until age 14. He then attended Groton School, an Episcopal boarding school in Groton, Massachusetts.[11] He was not among the more popular Groton students, who were better athletes and had rebellious streaks.[12] Its headmaster, Endicott Peabody, preached the duty of Christians to help the less fortunate and urged his students to enter public service. Peabody remained a strong influence throughout Roosevelt's life, officiating at his wedding and visiting him as president.[13][14]"", 'Like most of his Groton classmates, Roosevelt went to Harvard College.[12] He was a member of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity[15] and the Fly Club,[16] and served as a school cheerleader.[17] Roosevelt was relatively undistinguished as a student or athlete, but he became editor-in-chief of The Harvard Crimson daily newspaper, which required ambition, energy, and the ability to manage others.[18] He later said, ""I took economics courses in college for four years, and everything I was taught was wrong.""[19]', ""Roosevelt's father died in 1900, distressing him greatly.[20] The following year, Roosevelt's fifth cousin Theodore Roosevelt became U.S. president. Theodore's vigorous leadership style and reforming zeal made him Franklin's role model and hero.[21] He graduated from Harvard in three years in 1903 with an A.B. in history.[22] He remained there for a fourth year, taking graduate courses.[23] Like his cousin Theodore, he was a member of The Explorers Club.[24]"", ""Roosevelt entered Columbia Law School in 1904, but dropped out in 1907 after passing the New York bar examination.[25][b] In 1908, he took a job with the prestigious law firm of Carter Ledyard & Milburn, working in the firm's admiralty law division.[27]"", ""During his second year of college, Roosevelt met and proposed to Boston heiress Alice Sohier, who turned him down.[12] Franklin then began courting his childhood acquaintance and fifth cousin once removed, Eleanor Roosevelt, a niece of Theodore Roosevelt.[28] In 1903, Franklin proposed to Eleanor. Despite resistance from his mother, Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt were married on March 17, 1905.[12][29] Eleanor's father, Elliott, was deceased; Theodore, who was then president, gave away the bride.[30] The young couple moved into Springwood. Franklin's mother, Sara Roosevelt, also provided a townhouse for the newlyweds in New York City, and had a house built for herself alongside that townhouse. Eleanor never felt at home in the houses at Hyde Park or New York; however, she loved the family's vacation home on Campobello Island, which was also a gift from Sara.[31]"", 'Burns indicates that young Franklin Roosevelt was self-assured and at ease in the upper class. On the other hand, Eleanor was shy and disliked social life. Initially, Eleanor stayed home to raise their children.[32] As his father had done, Franklin left childcare to his wife, and Eleanor delegated the task to caregivers. She later said that she knew ""absolutely nothing about handling or feeding a baby.""[33] They had six children. Anna, James, and Elliott were born in 1906, 1907, and 1910, respectively. The couple\'s second son, Franklin, died in infancy in 1909. Another son, also named Franklin, was born in 1914, and the youngest, John, was born in 1916.[34]', ""Roosevelt had several extramarital affairs. He commenced an affair with Eleanor's social secretary, Lucy Mercer, soon after she was hired in 1914. That affair was discovered by Eleanor in 1918.[35] Franklin contemplated divorcing Eleanor, but Sara objected, and Mercer would not marry a divorced man with five children.[36] Franklin and Eleanor remained married, and Franklin promised never to see Mercer again. Eleanor never forgave him for the affair, and their marriage shifted to become a political partnership.[37] Eleanor soon established a separate home in Hyde Park at Val-Kill and devoted herself to social and political causes independent of her husband. The emotional break in their marriage was so severe that when Franklin asked Eleanor in 1942—in light of his failing health—to come live with him again, she refused.[38] Roosevelt was not always aware of Eleanor's visits to the White House. For some time, Eleanor could not easily reach Roosevelt on the telephone without his secretary's help; Franklin, in turn, did not visit Eleanor's New York City apartment until late 1944.[39]"", 'Franklin broke his promise to Eleanor regarding Lucy Mercer. He and Mercer maintained a formal correspondence and began seeing each other again by 1941.[40][41] Roosevelt\'s son Elliott claimed that his father had a 20-year affair with his private secretary, Marguerite LeHand.[42] Another son, James, stated that ""there is a real possibility that a romantic relationship existed"" between his father and Crown Princess Märtha of Norway, who resided in the White House during part of World War II. Aides referred to her at the time as ""the president\'s girlfriend"",[43] and gossip linking the two romantically appeared in newspapers.[44]', ""Roosevelt cared little for the practice of law and told friends he planned to enter politics.[45] Despite his admiration for cousin Theodore, Franklin shared his father's bond with the Democratic Party, and in preparation for the 1910 elections, the party recruited Roosevelt to run for a seat in the New York State Assembly.[46] Roosevelt was a compelling recruit: he had the personality and energy for campaigning and the money to pay for his own campaign.[47] But Roosevelt's campaign for the state assembly ended after the Democratic incumbent, Lewis Stuyvesant Chanler, chose to seek re-election. Rather than putting his political hopes on hold, Roosevelt ran for a seat in the state senate.[48] The senate district, located in Dutchess, Columbia, and Putnam, was strongly Republican.[49] Roosevelt feared that opposition from Theodore could end his campaign, but Theodore encouraged his candidacy despite their party differences.[46] Acting as his own campaign manager, Roosevelt traveled throughout the senate district via automobile at a time when few could afford a car.[50] Due to his aggressive campaign,[51] his name gained recognition in the Hudson Valley, and in the Democratic landslide in the 1910 United States elections, Roosevelt won a surprising victory.[52]"", 'Despite short legislative sessions, Roosevelt treated his new position as a full-time career.[53] Taking his seat on January 1, 1911, Roosevelt soon became the leader of a group of ""Insurgents"" in opposition to the Tammany Hall machine that dominated the state Democratic Party. In the 1911 U.S. Senate election, which was determined in a joint session of the New York state legislature,[c] Roosevelt and nineteen other Democrats caused a prolonged deadlock by opposing a series of Tammany-backed candidates. Tammany threw its backing behind James A. O\'Gorman, a highly regarded judge whom Roosevelt found acceptable, and O\'Gorman won the election in late March.[54] Roosevelt in the process became a popular figure among New York Democrats.[52] News articles and cartoons depicted ""the second coming of a Roosevelt"", sending ""cold shivers down the spine of Tammany"".[55]', ""Roosevelt also opposed Tammany Hall by supporting New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson's successful bid for the 1912 Democratic nomination.[56] The election became a three-way contest when Theodore Roosevelt left the Republican Party to launch a third-party campaign against Wilson and sitting Republican president William Howard Taft. Franklin's decision to back Wilson over his cousin in the general election alienated some of his family, except Theodore.[57] Roosevelt overcame a bout of typhoid fever that year and, with help from journalist Louis McHenry Howe, he was re-elected in the 1912 elections. After the election, he served as chairman of the Agriculture Committee; his success with farm and labor bills was a precursor to his later New Deal policies.[58] He had then become more consistently progressive, in support of labor and social welfare programs.[59]"", ""Roosevelt's support of Wilson led to his appointment in March 1913 as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, the second-ranking official in the Navy Department after Secretary Josephus Daniels who paid it little attention.[60] Roosevelt had an affection for the Navy, was well-read on the subject, and was an ardent supporter of a large, efficient force.[61][62] With Wilson's support, Daniels and Roosevelt instituted a merit-based promotion system and extended civilian control over the autonomous departments of the Navy.[63] Roosevelt oversaw the Navy's civilian employees and earned the respect of union leaders for his fairness in resolving disputes.[64] No strikes occurred during his seven-plus years in the office,[65] as he gained valuable experience in labor issues, wartime management, naval issues, and logistics.[66]"", ""In 1914, Roosevelt ran for the seat of retiring Republican Senator Elihu Root of New York. Though he had the backing of Treasury Secretary William Gibbs McAdoo and Governor Martin H. Glynn, he faced a formidable opponent in Tammany Hall's James W. Gerard.[67] He also was without Wilson's support, as the president needed Tammany's forces for his legislation and 1916 re-election.[68] Roosevelt was soundly defeated in the Democratic primary by Gerard, who in turn lost the general election to Republican James Wolcott Wadsworth Jr. He learned that federal patronage alone, without White House support, could not defeat a strong local organization.[69] After the election, he and Tammany Hall boss Charles Francis Murphy sought accommodation and became allies.[70]"", ""Roosevelt refocused on the Navy Department as World War I broke out in Europe in August 1914.[71] Though he remained publicly supportive of Wilson, Roosevelt sympathized with the Preparedness Movement, whose leaders strongly favored the Allied Powers and called for a military build-up.[72] The Wilson administration initiated an expansion of the Navy after the sinking of the RMS Lusitania by a German submarine, and Roosevelt helped establish the United States Navy Reserve and the Council of National Defense.[73] In April 1917, after Germany declared it would engage in unrestricted submarine warfare and attacked several U.S. ships, Congress approved Wilson's call for a declaration of war on Germany.[74]"", 'Roosevelt requested that he be allowed to serve as a naval officer, but Wilson insisted that he continue as Assistant Secretary. For the next year, Roosevelt remained in Washington to coordinate the naval deployment, as the Navy expanded fourfold.[75][76] In the summer of 1918, Roosevelt traveled to Europe to inspect naval installations and meet with French and British officials. On account of his relation to Theodore Roosevelt, he was received very prominently considering his relatively junior rank, obtaining long private audiences with King George V and prime ministers David Lloyd George and Georges Clemenceau, as well as a tour of the battlefield at Verdun.[77] In September, on the ship voyage back to the United States, he contracted pandemic influenza with complicating pneumonia,[78] which left him unable to work for a month.[77]', 'After Germany signed an armistice in November 1918, Daniels and Roosevelt supervised the demobilization of the Navy.[79] Against the advice of older officers such as Admiral William Benson—who claimed he could not ""conceive of any use the fleet will ever have for aviation""—Roosevelt personally ordered the preservation of the Navy\'s Aviation Division.[80] With the Wilson administration near an end, Roosevelt planned his next run for office. He approached Herbert Hoover about running for the 1920 Democratic presidential nomination, with Roosevelt as his running mate.[81]', ""Roosevelt's plan for Hoover to run fell through after Hoover publicly declared himself to be a Republican, but Roosevelt decided to seek the 1920 vice presidential nomination. After Governor James M. Cox of Ohio won the party's presidential nomination at the 1920 Democratic National Convention, he chose Roosevelt as his running mate, and the convention nominated him by acclamation.[82] Although his nomination surprised most people, he balanced the ticket as a moderate, a Wilsonian, and a prohibitionist with a famous name.[83][84] Roosevelt, then 38, resigned as Assistant Secretary after the Democratic convention and campaigned across the nation for the party ticket.[85]"", 'During the campaign, Cox and Roosevelt defended the Wilson administration and the League of Nations, both of which were unpopular in 1920.[86] Roosevelt personally supported U.S. membership in the League, but, unlike Wilson, he favored compromising with Senator Henry Cabot Lodge and other ""Reservationists"".[87] Republicans Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge defeated the Cox–Roosevelt ticket in the presidential election by a wide margin, carrying every state outside of the South.[88] Roosevelt accepted the loss and later reflected that the relationships and goodwill that he built in the 1920 campaign proved to be a major asset in his 1932 campaign. The 1920 election also saw the first public participation of Eleanor Roosevelt who, with the support of Louis Howe, established herself as a valuable political player.[89] After the election, Roosevelt returned to New York City, where he practiced law and served as a vice president of the Fidelity and Deposit Company.[90]', ' Roosevelt sought to build support for a political comeback in the 1922 elections, but his career was derailed by an illness.[90] It began while the Roosevelts were vacationing at Campobello Island in August 1921. His main symptoms were fever; symmetric, ascending paralysis; facial paralysis; bowel and bladder dysfunction; numbness and hyperesthesia; and a descending pattern of recovery. Roosevelt was left permanently paralyzed from the waist down and was diagnosed with polio. A 2003 study strongly favored a diagnosis of Guillain–Barré syndrome,[91] but historians have continued to describe his paralysis according to the initial diagnosis.[92][93][94][95]', ""Though his mother favored his retirement from public life, Roosevelt, his wife, and Roosevelt's close friend and adviser, Louis Howe, were all determined that he continue his political career.[96] He convinced many people that he was improving, which he believed to be essential prior to running for office.[97] He laboriously taught himself to walk short distances while wearing iron braces on his hips and legs, by swiveling his torso while supporting himself with a cane.[98] He was careful never to be seen using his wheelchair in public, and great care was taken to prevent any portrayal in the press that would highlight his disability.[99] However, his disability was well known before and during his presidency and became a major part of his image. He usually appeared in public standing upright, supported on one side by an aide or one of his sons.[100]"", 'Beginning in 1925, Roosevelt spent most of his time in the Southern United States, at first on his houseboat, the Larooco.[101] Intrigued by the potential benefits of hydrotherapy, he established a rehabilitation center at Warm Springs, Georgia, in 1926, assembling a staff of physical therapists and using most of his inheritance to purchase the Merriweather Inn. In 1938, he founded the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, leading to the development of polio vaccines.[102]', ""Roosevelt remained active in New York politics while also establishing contacts in the South, particularly in Georgia, in the 1920s.[103] He issued an open letter endorsing Al Smith's successful campaign in New York's 1922 gubernatorial election, which both aided Smith and showed Roosevelt's continuing relevance as a political figure.[104] Roosevelt and Smith came from different backgrounds and never fully trusted one another, but Roosevelt supported Smith's progressive policies, while Smith was happy to have Roosevelt's backing.[105]"", 'Roosevelt gave presidential nominating speeches for Smith at the 1924 and 1928 Democratic National Conventions; the speech at the 1924 convention marked a return to public life following his illness and convalescence.[106] That year, the Democrats were badly divided between an urban wing, led by Smith, and a conservative, rural wing, led by William Gibbs McAdoo. On the 101st ballot, the nomination went to John W. Davis, a compromise candidate who suffered a landslide defeat in the 1924 presidential election. Like many, Roosevelt did not abstain from alcohol during Prohibition, but publicly he sought to find a compromise on the issue acceptable to both wings of the party.[107]', ""In 1925, Smith appointed Roosevelt to the Taconic State Park Commission, and his fellow commissioners chose him as chairman.[108] In this role, he came into conflict with Robert Moses, a Smith protégé,[108] who was the primary force behind the Long Island State Park Commission and the New York State Council of Parks.[108] Roosevelt accused Moses of using the name recognition of prominent individuals including Roosevelt to win political support for state parks, but then diverting funds to the ones Moses favored on Long Island, while Moses worked to block the appointment of Howe to a salaried position as the Taconic commission's secretary.[108] Roosevelt served on the commission until the end of 1928,[109] and his contentious relationship with Moses continued as their careers progressed.[110]"", 'In 1923 Edward Bok established the $100,000 American Peace Award for the best plan to deliver world peace. Roosevelt had leisure time and interest, and he drafted a plan for the contest. He never submitted it because Eleanor was selected as a judge for the prize. His plan called for a new world organization that would replace the League of Nations.[111] Although Roosevelt had been the vice-presidential candidate on the Democratic ticket of 1920 that supported the League, by 1924 he was ready to scrap it. His draft of a ""Society of Nations"" accepted the reservations proposed by Henry Cabot Lodge in the 1919 Senate debate. The new Society would not become involved in the Western Hemisphere, where the Monroe doctrine held sway. It would not have any control over military forces. Although Roosevelt\'s plan was never made public, he thought about the problem a great deal and incorporated some of his 1924 ideas into the design for the United Nations in 1944–1945.[112]', ""Smith, the Democratic presidential nominee in the 1928 presidential election, asked Roosevelt to run for governor of New York in the 1928 state election.[113] Roosevelt initially resisted, as he was reluctant to leave Warm Springs and feared a Republican landslide.[114] Party leaders eventually convinced him only he could defeat the Republican gubernatorial nominee, New York Attorney General Albert Ottinger.[115] He won the party's gubernatorial nomination by acclamation and again turned to Howe to lead his campaign. Roosevelt was joined on the campaign trail by associates Samuel Rosenman, Frances Perkins, and James Farley.[116] While Smith lost the presidency in a landslide, and was defeated in his home state, Roosevelt was elected governor by a one-percent margin,[117] and became a contender in the next presidential election.[118]"", 'Roosevelt proposed the construction of hydroelectric power plants and addressed the ongoing farm crisis of the 1920s.[119] Relations between Roosevelt and Smith suffered after he chose not to retain key Smith appointees like Moses.[120] He and his wife Eleanor established an understanding for the rest of his career; she would dutifully serve as the governor\'s wife but would also be free to pursue her own agenda and interests.[121] He also began holding ""fireside chats"", in which he directly addressed his constituents via radio, often pressuring the New York State Legislature to advance his agenda.[122]', 'In October 1929, the Wall Street Crash occurred and the Great Depression in the United States began.[123] Roosevelt saw the seriousness of the situation and established a state employment commission. He also became the first governor to publicly endorse the idea of unemployment insurance.[124]', 'When Roosevelt began his run for a second term in May 1930, he reiterated his doctrine from the campaign two years before: ""that progressive government by its very terms must be a living and growing thing, that the battle for it is never-ending and that if we let up for one single moment or one single year, not merely do we stand still but we fall back in the march of civilization.""[125] His platform called for aid to farmers, full employment, unemployment insurance, and old-age pensions.[126] He was elected to a second term by a 14% margin.[127]', ""Roosevelt proposed an economic relief package and the establishment of the Temporary Emergency Relief Administration to distribute those funds. Led first by Jesse I. Straus and then by Harry Hopkins, the agency assisted over one-third of New York's population between 1932 and 1938.[128] Roosevelt also began an investigation into corruption in New York City among the judiciary, the police force, and organized crime, prompting the creation of the Seabury Commission. The Seabury investigations exposed an extortion ring, led many public officials to be removed from office, and made the decline of Tammany Hall inevitable.[129] Roosevelt supported reforestation with the Hewitt Amendment in 1931, which gave birth to New York's State Forest system.[130]"", 'As the 1932 presidential election approached, Roosevelt turned his attention to national politics, established a campaign team led by Howe and Farley, and a ""brain trust"" of policy advisers, primarily composed of Columbia University and Harvard University professors.[131] Some were not so sanguine about his chances, such as Walter Lippmann, the dean of political commentators, who observed: ""He is a pleasant man who, without any important qualifications for the office, would very much like to be president.""[132]', ""However, Roosevelt's efforts as governor to address the effects of the depression in his own state established him as the front-runner for the 1932 Democratic presidential nomination.[132] Roosevelt rallied the progressive supporters of the Wilson administration while also appealing to many conservatives, establishing himself as the leading candidate in the South and West. The chief opposition to Roosevelt's candidacy came from Northeastern conservatives, Speaker of the House John Nance Garner of Texas and Al Smith, the 1928 Democratic presidential nominee.[132]"", 'Roosevelt entered the convention with a delegate lead due to his success in the 1932 Democratic primaries, but most delegates entered the convention unbound to any particular candidate. On the first presidential ballot, Roosevelt received the votes of more than half but less than two-thirds of the delegates, with Smith finishing in a distant second place. Roosevelt then promised the vice-presidential nomination to Garner, who controlled the votes of Texas and California; Garner threw his support behind Roosevelt after the third ballot, and Roosevelt clinched the nomination on the fourth ballot.[132] Roosevelt flew in from New York to Chicago after learning that he had won the nomination, becoming the first major-party presidential nominee to accept the nomination in person.[133] His appearance was essential, to show himself as vigorous, despite his physical disability.[132]', 'In his acceptance speech, Roosevelt declared, ""I pledge you, I pledge myself to a new deal for the American people... This is more than a political campaign. It is a call to arms.""[134] Roosevelt promised securities regulation, tariff reduction, farm relief, government-funded public works, and other government actions to address the Great Depression.[135] Reflecting changing public opinion, the Democratic platform included a call for the repeal of Prohibition; Roosevelt himself had not taken a public stand on the issue prior to the convention but promised to uphold the party platform.[136] Otherwise, Roosevelt\'s primary campaign strategy was one of caution, intent upon avoiding mistakes that would distract from Hoover\'s failings on the economy. His statements attacked the incumbent and included no other specific policies or programs.[132]', ""After the convention, Roosevelt won endorsements from several progressive Republicans, including George W. Norris, Hiram Johnson, and Robert La Follette Jr.[137] He also reconciled with the party's conservative wing, and even Al Smith was persuaded to support the Democratic ticket.[138] Hoover's handling of the Bonus Army further damaged the incumbent's popularity, as newspapers across the country criticized the use of force to disperse assembled veterans.[139]"", 'Roosevelt won 57% of the popular vote and carried all but six states. Historians and political scientists consider the 1932–36 elections to be a political realignment. Roosevelt\'s victory was enabled by the creation of the New Deal coalition, small farmers, the Southern whites, Catholics, big-city political machines, labor unions, northern black Americans (southern ones were still disfranchised), Jews, intellectuals, and political liberals.[140] The creation of the New Deal coalition transformed American politics and started what political scientists call the ""New Deal Party System"" or the Fifth Party System.[141] Between the Civil War and 1929, Democrats had rarely controlled both houses of Congress and had won just four of seventeen presidential elections; from 1932 to 1979, Democrats won eight of twelve presidential elections and generally controlled both houses of Congress.[142]', ""Roosevelt was elected in November 1932 but like his predecessors did not take office until the following March.[d] After the election, President Hoover sought to convince Roosevelt to renounce much of his campaign platform and to endorse the Hoover administration's policies.[143] Roosevelt refused Hoover's request to develop a joint program to stop the economic decline, claiming that it would tie his hands and that Hoover had the power to act.[144]"", 'During the transition, Roosevelt chose Howe as his chief of staff, and Farley as Postmaster General. Frances Perkins, as Secretary of Labor, became the first woman appointed to a cabinet position.[132] William H. Woodin, a Republican industrialist close to Roosevelt, was chosen for Secretary of the Treasury, while Roosevelt chose Senator Cordell Hull of Tennessee as Secretary of State. Harold L. Ickes and Henry A. Wallace, two progressive Republicans, were selected for Secretary of the Interior and Secretary of Agriculture, respectively.[145]', 'In February 1933, Roosevelt escaped an assassination attempt by Giuseppe Zangara, who expressed a ""hate for all rulers"". As he was attempting to shoot Roosevelt, Zangara was struck by a woman with her purse; he instead mortally wounded Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak, who was sitting alongside Roosevelt.[146][147]', ""As president, Roosevelt appointed powerful men to top positions in government. However, he made all of his administration's major decisions himself, regardless of any delays, inefficiencies, or resentments doing so may have caused. Analyzing the president's administrative style, Burns concludes:"", 'The president stayed in charge of his administration...by drawing fully on his formal and informal powers as Chief Executive; by raising goals, creating momentum, inspiring a personal loyalty, getting the best out of people...by deliberately fostering among his aides a sense of competition and a clash of wills that led to disarray, heartbreak, and anger but also set off pulses of executive energy and sparks of creativity...by handing out one job to several men and several jobs to one man, thus strengthening his own position as a court of appeals, as a depository of information, and as a tool of co-ordination; by ignoring or bypassing collective decision-making agencies, such as the Cabinet...and always by persuading, flattering, juggling, improvising, reshuffling, harmonizing, conciliating, manipulating.[148]', 'When Roosevelt was inaugurated on March 4, 1933, the U.S. was at the nadir of the worst depression in its history. A quarter of the workforce was unemployed, and farmers were in deep trouble as prices had fallen by 60%. Industrial production had fallen by more than half since 1929. Two million people were homeless. By the evening of March 4, 32 of the 48 states—as well as the District of Columbia—had closed their banks.[149]', 'Historians categorized Roosevelt\'s program as ""relief, recovery, and reform"". Relief was urgently needed by the unemployed. Recovery meant boosting the economy back to normal, and reform was required of the financial and banking systems. Through Roosevelt\'s 30 ""fireside chats"", he presented his proposals directly to the American public as a series of radio addresses.[150] Energized by his own victory over paralytic illness, he used persistent optimism and activism to renew the national spirit.[151]', 'On his second day in office, Roosevelt declared a four-day national ""bank holiday"", to end the run by depositors seeking to withdraw funds.[152] He called for a special session of Congress on March 9, when Congress passed, almost sight unseen, the Emergency Banking Act.[152] The act, first developed by the Hoover administration and Wall Street bankers, gave the president the power to determine the opening and closing of banks and authorized the Federal Reserve Banks to issue banknotes.[153] The ""first 100 Days"" of the 73rd United States Congress saw an unprecedented amount of legislation and set a benchmark against which future presidents have been compared.[154][155] When the banks reopened on Monday, March 15, stock prices rose by 15 percent and in the following weeks over $1 billion was returned to bank vaults, ending the bank panic.[152] On March 22, Roosevelt signed the Cullen–Harrison Act, which brought Prohibition to a close.[156]', 'Roosevelt saw the establishment of a number of agencies and measures designed to provide relief for the unemployed and others. The Federal Emergency Relief Administration, under the leadership of Harry Hopkins, distributed relief to state governments.[157] The Public Works Administration (PWA), under Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes, oversaw the construction of large-scale public works such as dams, bridges, and schools.[157] The Rural Electrification Administration (REA) brought electricity for the first time to millions of rural homes.[152] The most popular of all New Deal agencies—and Roosevelt\'s favorite—was the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), which hired 250,000 unemployed men for rural projects. Roosevelt also expanded Hoover\'s Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which financed railroads and industry. Congress gave the Federal Trade Commission broad regulatory powers and provided mortgage relief to millions of farmers and homeowners. Roosevelt also set up the Agricultural Adjustment Administration to increase commodity prices, by paying farmers to leave land uncultivated and cut herds.[158] In many instances, crops were plowed under and livestock killed, while many Americans died of hunger and were ill-clothed; critics labeled such policies ""utterly idiotic"".[152]', ""Reform of the economy was the goal of the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) of 1933. It sought to end cutthroat competition by forcing industries to establish rules such as minimum prices, agreements not to compete, and production restrictions. Industry leaders negotiated the rules with NIRA officials, who suspended antitrust laws in return for better wages. The Supreme Court in May 1935 declared NIRA unconstitutional, to Roosevelt's chagrin.[159] He reformed financial regulations with the Glass–Steagall Act, creating the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to underwrite savings deposits. The act also limited affiliations between commercial banks and securities firms.[160] In 1934, the Securities and Exchange Commission was created to regulate the trading of securities, while the Federal Communications Commission was established to regulate telecommunications.[161]"", 'The NIRA included $3.3\xa0billion (equivalent to $77.67\xa0billion in 2023) of spending through the Public Works Administration to support recovery.[162] Roosevelt worked with Senator Norris to create the largest government-owned industrial enterprise in American history—the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)—which built dams and power stations, controlled floods, and modernized agriculture and home conditions in the poverty-stricken Tennessee Valley. However, locals criticized the TVA for displacing thousands of people for these projects.[152] The Soil Conservation Service trained farmers in the proper methods of cultivation, and with the TVA, Roosevelt became the father of soil conservation.[152] Executive Order 6102 declared that all privately held gold of American citizens was to be sold to the U.S. Treasury and the price raised from $20 to $35 per ounce. The goal was to counter the deflation which was paralyzing the economy.[163]', ""Roosevelt tried to keep his campaign promise by cutting the federal budget. This included a reduction in military spending from $752\xa0million in 1932 to $531\xa0million in 1934 and a 40% cut in spending on veterans benefits. 500,000 veterans and widows were removed from the pension rolls, and benefits were reduced for the remainder. Federal salaries were cut and spending on research and education was reduced. The veterans were well organized and strongly protested, so most benefits were restored or increased by 1934.[164] Veterans groups such as the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars won their campaign to transform their benefits from payments due in 1945 to immediate cash when Congress overrode the President's veto and passed the Bonus Act in January 1936.[165] It pumped sums equal to 2% of the GDP into the consumer economy and had a major stimulus effect.[166]"", 'Roosevelt expected that his party would lose seats in the 1934 Congressional elections, as the president\'s party had done in most previous midterm elections; the Democrats gained seats instead. Empowered by the public\'s vote of confidence, the first item on Roosevelt\'s agenda in the 74th Congress was the creation of a social insurance program.[167] The Social Security Act established Social Security and promised economic security for the elderly, the poor, and the sick. Roosevelt insisted that it should be funded by payroll taxes rather than from the general fund, saying, ""We put those payroll contributions there so as to give the contributors a legal, moral, and political right to collect their pensions and unemployment benefits. With those taxes in there, no damn politician can ever scrap my social security program.""[168] Compared with the social security systems in Western European countries, the Social Security Act of 1935 was rather conservative. But for the first time, the federal government took responsibility for the economic security of the aged, the temporarily unemployed, dependent children, and disabled people.[169] Against Roosevelt\'s original intention for universal coverage, the act excluded farmers, domestic workers, and other groups, which made up about forty percent of the labor force.[170]', 'Roosevelt consolidated the various relief organizations, though some, like the PWA, continued to exist. After winning Congressional authorization for further funding of relief efforts, he established the Works Progress Administration (WPA). Under the leadership of Harry Hopkins, the WPA employed over three million people in its first year of operations. It undertook numerous massive construction projects in cooperation with local governments. It also set up the National Youth Administration and arts organizations.[171]', 'The National Labor Relations Act guaranteed workers the right to collective bargaining through unions of their own choice. The act also established the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to facilitate wage agreements and suppress repeated labor disturbances. The act did not compel employers to reach an agreement with their employees, but it opened possibilities for American labor.[172] The result was a tremendous growth of membership in the labor unions, especially in the mass-production sector.[173] When the Flint sit-down strike threatened the production of General Motors, Roosevelt broke with the precedent set by many former presidents and refused to intervene; the strike ultimately led to the unionization of both General Motors and its rivals in the American automobile industry.[174]', ""While the First New Deal of 1933 had broad support from most sectors, the Second New Deal challenged the business community. Conservative Democrats, led by Al Smith, fought back with the American Liberty League, savagely attacking Roosevelt and equating him with socialism.[175] But Smith overplayed his hand, and his boisterous rhetoric let Roosevelt isolate his opponents and identify them with the wealthy vested interests that opposed the New Deal, strengthening Roosevelt for the 1936 landslide.[175] By contrast, labor unions, energized by labor legislation, signed up millions of new members and became a major backer of Roosevelt's re-elections in 1936, 1940, and 1944.[176]"", 'Burns suggests that Roosevelt\'s policy decisions were guided more by pragmatism than ideology and that he ""was like the general of a guerrilla army whose columns, fighting blindly in the mountains through dense ravines and thickets, suddenly converge, half by plan and half by coincidence, and debouch into the plain below.""[177] Roosevelt argued that such apparently haphazard methodology was necessary. ""The country needs and, unless I mistake its temper, the country demands bold, persistent experimentation,"" he wrote. ""It is common sense to take a method and try it; if it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But above all, try something.""[178]', 'Eight million workers remained unemployed in 1936, and though economic conditions had improved since 1932, they remained sluggish. By 1936, Roosevelt had lost the backing he once held in the business community because of his support for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and the Social Security Act.[132] The Republicans had few alternative candidates and nominated Kansas Governor Alf Landon, a little-known bland candidate whose chances were damaged by the public re-emergence of the still-unpopular Herbert Hoover.[179] While Roosevelt campaigned on his New Deal programs and continued to attack Hoover, Landon sought to win voters who approved of the goals of the New Deal but disagreed with its implementation.[180]', ""An attempt by Louisiana Senator Huey Long to organize a left-wing third party collapsed after Long's assassination in 1935. The remnants, helped by Father Charles Coughlin, supported William Lemke of the newly formed Union Party.[181] Roosevelt won re-nomination with little opposition at the 1936 Democratic National Convention, while his allies overcame Southern resistance to abolish the long-established rule that required Democratic presidential candidates to win the votes of two-thirds of the delegates rather than a simple majority.[e]"", ""In the election against Landon and a third-party candidate, Roosevelt won 60.8% of the vote and carried every state except Maine and Vermont.[183] The Democratic ticket won the highest proportion of the popular vote.[f] Democrats expanded their majorities in Congress, controlling over three-quarters of the seats in each house. The election also saw the consolidation of the New Deal coalition; while the Democrats lost some of their traditional allies in big business, they were replaced by groups such as organized labor and African Americans, the latter of whom voted Democratic for the first time since the Civil War.[184] Roosevelt lost high-income voters, especially businessmen and professionals, but made major gains among the poor and minorities. He won 86 percent of the Jewish vote, 81 percent of Catholics, 80 percent of union members, 76 percent of Southerners, 76 percent of blacks in northern cities, and 75 percent of people on relief. Roosevelt carried 102 of the country's 106 cities with a population of 100,000 or more.[185]"", 'The Supreme Court became Roosevelt\'s primary domestic focus during his second term after the court overturned many of his programs, including NIRA. The more conservative members of the court upheld the principles of the Lochner era, which saw numerous economic regulations struck down on the basis of freedom of contract.[186] Roosevelt proposed the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937, which would have allowed him to appoint an additional Justice for each incumbent Justice over the age of 70; in 1937, there were six Supreme Court Justices over the age of 70. The size of the Court had been set at nine since the passage of the Judiciary Act of 1869, and Congress had altered the number of Justices six other times throughout U.S. history.[187] Roosevelt\'s ""court packing"" plan ran into intense political opposition from his own party, led by Vice President Garner since it upset the separation of powers.[188] A bipartisan coalition of liberals and conservatives of both parties opposed the bill, and Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes broke with precedent by publicly advocating the defeat of the bill. Any chance of passing the bill ended with the death of Senate Majority Leader Joseph Taylor Robinson in July 1937.[189]', 'Starting with the 1937 case of West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, the court began to take a more favorable view of economic regulations. Historians have described this as, ""the switch in time that saved nine"".[152] That same year, Roosevelt appointed a Supreme Court Justice for the first time, and by 1941, had appointed seven of the court\'s nine justices.[g][190] After Parrish, the Court shifted its focus from judicial review of economic regulations to the protection of civil liberties.[191] Four of Roosevelt\'s Supreme Court appointees, Felix Frankfurter, Robert H. Jackson,Hugo Black, and William O. Douglas, were particularly influential in reshaping the jurisprudence of the Court.[192][193]', 'With Roosevelt\'s influence on the wane following the failure of the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937, conservative Democrats joined with Republicans to block the implementation of further New Deal programs.[194] Roosevelt did manage to pass some legislation, including the Housing Act of 1937, a second Agricultural Adjustment Act, and the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938, which was the last major piece of New Deal legislation. The FLSA outlawed child labor, established a federal minimum wage, and required overtime pay for certain employees who work in excess of forty hours per week.[195] He also passed the Reorganization Act of 1939 and subsequently created the Executive Office of the President, making it ""the nerve center of the federal administrative system"".[196] When the economy began to deteriorate again in mid-1937, Roosevelt launched a rhetorical campaign against big business and monopoly power, alleging that the recession was the result of a capital strike and even ordering the Federal Bureau of Investigation to look for a criminal conspiracy (they found none). He then asked Congress for $5\xa0billion (equivalent to $105.97\xa0billion in 2023) in relief and public works funding. This created as many as 3.3\xa0million WPA jobs by 1938. Projects accomplished under the WPA ranged from new federal courthouses and post offices to facilities and infrastructure for national parks, bridges, and other infrastructure across the country, and architectural surveys and archaeological excavations—investments to construct facilities and preserve important resources. Beyond this, however, Roosevelt recommended to a special congressional session only a permanent national farm act, administrative reorganization, and regional planning measures, all of which were leftovers from a regular session. According to Burns, this attempt illustrated Roosevelt\'s inability to settle on a basic economic program.[197]', ""Determined to overcome the opposition of conservative Democrats in Congress, Roosevelt became involved in the 1938 Democratic primaries, actively campaigning for challengers who were more supportive of New Deal reform. Roosevelt failed badly, managing to defeat only one of the ten targeted.[152] In the November 1938 elections, Democrats lost six Senate seats and 71 House seats, with losses concentrated among pro-New Deal Democrats. When Congress reconvened in 1939, Republicans under Senator Robert Taft formed a Conservative coalition with Southern Democrats, virtually ending Roosevelt's ability to enact his domestic proposals.[198] Despite their opposition to Roosevelt's domestic policies, many of these conservative Congressmen would provide crucial support for his foreign policy before and during World War II.[199]"", ""Roosevelt had a lifelong interest in the environment and conservation starting with his youthful interest in forestry on his family estate. Although he was never an outdoorsman or sportsman on Theodore Roosevelt's scale, his growth of the national systems was comparable.[200][201] When Franklin was Governor of New York, the Temporary Emergency Relief Administration was essentially a state-level predecessor of the federal Civilian Conservation Corps, with 10,000 or more men building fire trails, combating soil erosion and planting tree seedlings in marginal farmland in New York.[202] As President, Roosevelt was active in expanding, funding, and promoting the National Park and National Forest systems.[203] Their popularity soared, from three million visitors a year at the start of the decade to 15.5\xa0million in 1939.[204] The Civilian Conservation Corps enrolled 3.4\xa0million young men and built 13,000 miles (21,000 kilometers) of trails, planted two billion trees, and upgraded 125,000 miles (201,000 kilometers) of dirt roads. Every state had its own state parks, and Roosevelt made sure that WPA and CCC projects were set up to upgrade them as well as the national systems.[205][206][207]"", 'Government spending increased from 8.0% of the gross national product (GNP) under Hoover in 1932 to 10.2% in 1936. The national debt as a percentage of the GNP had more than doubled under Hoover from 16% to 40% of the GNP in early 1933. It held steady at close to 40% as late as fall 1941, then grew rapidly during the war.[209] The GNP was 34% higher in 1936 than in 1932 and 58% higher in 1940 on the eve of war. That is, the economy grew 58% from 1932 to 1940, and then grew 56% from 1940 to 1945 in five years of wartime.[209] Unemployment fell dramatically during Roosevelt\'s first term. It increased in 1938 (""a depression within a depression"") but continually declined after 1938.[208] Total employment during Roosevelt\'s term expanded by 18.31\xa0million jobs, with an average annual increase in jobs during his administration of 5.3%.[210][211]', 'The main foreign policy initiative of Roosevelt\'s first term was the Good Neighbor Policy, which was a re-evaluation of U.S. policy toward Latin America. The United States frequently intervened in Latin America following the promulgation of the Monroe Doctrine in 1823, and occupied several Latin American nations during the Banana Wars that occurred following the Spanish–American War of 1898. After Roosevelt took office, he withdrew U.S. forces from Haiti and reached new treaties with Cuba and Panama, ending their status as U.S. protectorates. In December 1933, Roosevelt signed the Montevideo Convention, renouncing the right to intervene unilaterally in the affairs of Latin American countries.[212] Roosevelt also normalized relations with the Soviet Union, which the United States had refused to recognize since the 1920s.[213] He hoped to renegotiate the Russian debt from World War I and open trade relations, but no progress was made on either issue and ""both nations were soon disillusioned by the accord.""[214]', 'The rejection of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919–1920 marked the dominance of non-interventionism in American foreign policy. Despite Roosevelt\'s Wilsonian background, he and Secretary of State Cordell Hull acted with great care not to provoke isolationist sentiment. The isolationist movement was bolstered in the early to mid-1930s by Senator Gerald Nye and others who succeeded in their effort to stop the ""merchants of death"" in the U.S. from selling arms abroad.[215] This effort took the form of the Neutrality Acts; the president was refused a provision he requested giving him the discretion to allow the sale of arms to victims of aggression.[216] He largely acquiesced to Congress\'s non-interventionist policies in the early-to-mid 1930s.[217] In the interim, Fascist Italy under Benito Mussolini proceeded to overcome Ethiopia, and the Italians joined Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler in supporting General Francisco Franco and the Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War.[218] As that conflict drew to a close in early 1939, Roosevelt expressed regret in not aiding the Spanish Republicans.[219] When Japan invaded China in 1937, isolationism limited Roosevelt\'s ability to aid China,[220] despite atrocities like the Nanking Massacre and the USS Panay incident.[221]', 'Germany annexed Austria in 1938, and soon turned its attention to its eastern neighbors.[223] Roosevelt made it clear that, in the event of German aggression against Czechoslovakia, the U.S. would remain neutral.[224] After completion of the Munich Agreement and the execution of Kristallnacht, American public opinion turned against Germany, and Roosevelt began preparing for a possible war with Germany.[225] Relying on an interventionist political coalition of Southern Democrats and business-oriented Republicans, Roosevelt oversaw the expansion of U.S. airpower and war production capacity.[226]', ""When World War II began in September 1939 with Germany's invasion of Poland and Britain and France's declaration of war on Germany, Roosevelt sought ways to assist Britain and France militarily.[227] Isolationist leaders like Charles Lindbergh and Senator William Borah successfully mobilized opposition to Roosevelt's proposed repeal of the Neutrality Act, but Roosevelt won Congressional approval of the sale of arms on a cash-and-carry basis.[228] He also began a regular secret correspondence with Britain's First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, in September 1939—the first of 1,700 letters and telegrams between them.[229] Roosevelt forged a close personal relationship with Churchill, who became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in May 1940.[230]"", ""The Fall of France in June 1940 shocked the American public, and isolationist sentiment declined.[231] In July 1940, Roosevelt appointed two interventionist Republican leaders, Henry L. Stimson and Frank Knox, as Secretaries of War and the Navy, respectively. Both parties gave support to his plans for a rapid build-up of the American military, but the isolationists warned that Roosevelt would get the nation into an unnecessary war with Germany.[232] In July 1940, a group of Congressmen introduced a bill that would authorize the nation's first peacetime draft, and with the support of the Roosevelt administration, the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 passed in September. The size of the army increased from 189,000 men at the end of 1939 to 1.4\xa0million in mid-1941.[233] In September 1940, Roosevelt openly defied the Neutrality Acts by reaching the Destroyers for Bases Agreement, which, in exchange for military base rights in the British Caribbean Islands, gave 50 American destroyers to Britain.[234]"", ""In the months prior to the July 1940 Democratic National Convention, there was much speculation as to whether Roosevelt would run for an unprecedented third term. The two-term tradition, although not yet enshrined in the Constitution,[i] had been established by George Washington when he refused to run for a third term in 1796. Roosevelt refused to give a definitive statement, and he even indicated to some ambitious Democrats, such as James Farley, that he would not run for a third term and that they could seek the Democratic nomination. Farley and Vice President John Garner were not pleased with Roosevelt when he ultimately made the decision to break from Washington's precedent.[132][235] As Germany swept through Western Europe and menaced Britain in mid-1940, Roosevelt decided that only he had the necessary experience and skills to see the nation safely through the Nazi threat. He was aided by the party's political bosses, who feared that no Democrat except Roosevelt could defeat Wendell Willkie, the popular Republican nominee.[236]"", 'At the July 1940 Democratic Convention in Chicago, Roosevelt easily swept aside challenges from Farley and Vice President Garner, who had turned against Roosevelt in his second term because of his liberal economic and social policies.[237] To replace Garner on the ticket, Roosevelt turned to Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace of Iowa, a former Republican who strongly supported the New Deal and was popular in farm states.[238] The choice was strenuously opposed by many of the party\'s conservatives, who felt Wallace was too radical and ""eccentric"" in his private life. But Roosevelt insisted that without Wallace on the ticket he would decline re-nomination, and Wallace won the vice-presidential nomination, defeating Speaker of the House William B. Bankhead and other candidates.[237]', ""A late August poll taken by Gallup found the race to be essentially tied, but Roosevelt's popularity surged in September following the announcement of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement.[239] Willkie supported much of the New Deal as well as rearmament and aid to Britain but warned that Roosevelt would drag the country into another European war.[240] Responding to Willkie's attacks, Roosevelt promised to keep the country out of the war.[241] Over its last month, the campaign degenerated into a series of outrageous accusations and mud-slinging by the parties.[132] Roosevelt won the 1940 election with 55% of the popular vote, 38 of the 48 states, and almost 85% of the electoral vote.[242]"", ""World War II dominated Roosevelt's attention, with far more time devoted to world affairs than ever before. Domestic politics and relations with Congress were largely shaped by his efforts to achieve total mobilization of the nation's economic, financial, and institutional resources for the war effort. Even relationships with Latin America and Canada were structured by wartime demands. Roosevelt maintained close personal control of all major diplomatic and military decisions, working closely with his generals and admirals, the war and Navy departments, the British, and even the Soviet Union. His key advisors on diplomacy were Harry Hopkins in the White House, Sumner Welles in the State Department, and Henry Morgenthau Jr. at Treasury. In military affairs, Roosevelt worked most closely with Secretary Henry L. Stimson at the War Department, Army Chief of Staff George Marshall, and Admiral William D. Leahy.[243][244][245]"", 'By late 1940, re-armament was in high gear, partly to expand and re-equip the Army and Navy and partly to become the ""Arsenal of Democracy"" for Britain and other countries.[246] With his Four Freedoms speech in January 1941, which proposed four fundamental freedoms that people ""everywhere in the world"" ought to enjoy: freedom of speech and expression, freedom of worship, freedom from want and freedom from fear, Roosevelt laid out the case for an Allied battle for basic rights throughout the world. Assisted by Willkie, Roosevelt won Congressional approval of the Lend-Lease program, which directed massive military and economic aid to Britain and China.[247] In sharp contrast to the loans of World War I, there would be no repayment.[248] As Roosevelt took a firmer stance against Japan, Germany, and Italy, American isolationists such as Charles Lindbergh and the America First Committee vehemently attacked Roosevelt as an irresponsible warmonger.[249] When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, Roosevelt agreed to extend Lend-Lease to the Soviets. Thus, Roosevelt had committed the U.S. to the Allied side with a policy of ""all aid short of war"".[250] By July 1941, Roosevelt authorized the creation of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs to counter perceived propaganda efforts in Latin America by Germany and Italy.[251][252]', 'In August 1941, Roosevelt and Churchill conducted a secret bilateral meeting in which they drafted the Atlantic Charter, conceptually outlining global wartime and postwar goals. This would be the first of several wartime conferences;[253] Churchill and Roosevelt would meet ten more times in person.[254] Though Churchill pressed for an American declaration of war against Germany, Roosevelt believed that Congress would reject any attempt to bring the U.S. into the war.[255] In September, a German submarine fired on the U.S. destroyer Greer, and Roosevelt declared that the U.S. Navy would assume an escort role for Allied convoys in the Atlantic as far east as Britain and would fire upon German ships or U-boats of the Kriegsmarine if they entered the U.S. Navy zone. This ""shoot on sight"" policy brought the U.S. Navy into direct conflict with German submarines and was favored by Americans by a margin of 2-to-1.[256]', ""After the German invasion of Poland, the primary concern of both Roosevelt and his top military staff was on the war in Europe, but Japan also presented foreign policy challenges. Relations with Japan had continually deteriorated since its invasion of Manchuria in 1931 and worsened further with Roosevelt's support of China.[257] After Roosevelt announced a $100\xa0million loan (equivalent to $2.2\xa0billion in 2023) to China in reaction to Japan's occupation of northern French Indochina, Japan signed the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy; Germany, Japan, and Italy became known as the Axis powers.[258] In July 1941, after Japan occupied the remainder of French Indochina, Roosevelt cut off the sale of oil to Japan, depriving Japan of more than 95 percent of its oil supply.[259] He also placed the Philippine military under American command and reinstated General Douglas MacArthur into active duty to command U.S. forces in the Philippines.[260]"", 'The Japanese were incensed by the embargo and Japanese leaders became determined to attack the United States unless it lifted the embargo. The Roosevelt administration was unwilling to reverse the policy, and Secretary of State Hull blocked a potential summit between Roosevelt and Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe.[j] After diplomatic efforts failed, the Privy Council of Japan authorized a strike against the United States.[262] The Japanese believed that the destruction of the United States Asiatic Fleet (stationed in the Philippines) and the United States Pacific Fleet (stationed at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii) was vital to the conquest of Southeast Asia.[263] On December 7, 1941, the Japanese launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, knocking out the main American battleship fleet and killing 2,403 American servicemen and civilians. At the same time, separate Japanese task forces attacked Thailand, British Hong Kong, the Philippines, and other targets. Roosevelt called for war in his ""Infamy Speech"" to Congress, in which he said: ""Yesterday, December 7, 1941—a date which will live in infamy—the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan."" In a nearly unanimous vote, Congress declared war on Japan.[264] After Pearl Harbor, antiwar sentiment in the United States largely evaporated overnight. On December 11, 1941, Hitler and Mussolini declared war on the United States, which responded in kind.[k][265]', 'A majority of scholars have rejected the conspiracy theories that Roosevelt, or any other high government officials, knew in advance about the attack on Pearl Harbor.[266] The Japanese had kept their secrets closely guarded, so it is unlikely that American officials were aware of Japanese plans for a surprise attack on the Pacific Fleet. Senior American officials were aware that war was imminent, but they did not expect an attack on Pearl Harbor.[267] Roosevelt assumed that the Japanese would attack either the Dutch East Indies or Thailand.[268]', 'In late December 1941, Churchill and Roosevelt met at the Arcadia Conference, which established a joint strategy between the U.S. and Britain. Both agreed on a Europe first strategy that prioritized the defeat of Germany before Japan. The U.S. and Britain established the Combined Chiefs of Staff to coordinate military policy and the Combined Munitions Assignments Board to coordinate the allocation of supplies.[269] An agreement was also reached to establish a centralized command in the Pacific theater called ABDA, named for the American, British, Dutch, and Australian forces in the theater.[270] On January 1, 1942, the United States and the other Allied Powers issued the Declaration by United Nations, in which each nation pledged to defeat the Axis powers.[271]', ""In 1942, Roosevelt formed a new body, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which made the final decisions on American military strategy. Admiral Ernest J. King as Chief of Naval Operations commanded the Navy and Marines, while General George C. Marshall led the Army and was in nominal control of the Air Force, which in practice was commanded by General Hap Arnold.[272] The Joint Chiefs were chaired by Admiral William D. Leahy, the most senior officer in the military.[273] Roosevelt avoided micromanaging the war and let his top military officers make most decisions.[274] Roosevelt's civilian appointees handled the draft and procurement of men and equipment, but no civilians—not even the secretaries of War or Navy—had a voice in strategy. Roosevelt avoided the State Department and conducted high-level diplomacy through his aides, especially Harry Hopkins, whose influence was bolstered by his control of the Lend-Lease funds.[275]"", 'In August 1939, Leo Szilard and Albert Einstein sent the Einstein–Szilárd letter to Roosevelt, warning of the possibility of a German project to develop nuclear weapons. Szilard realized that the recently discovered process of nuclear fission could be used to create a weapon of mass destruction.[276] Roosevelt feared the consequences of allowing Germany to have sole possession of the technology and authorized preliminary research into nuclear weapons.[l] After Pearl Harbor, the Roosevelt administration secured funding to continue research and selected General Leslie Groves to oversee the Manhattan Project, which was charged with developing the first nuclear weapons. Roosevelt and Churchill agreed to jointly pursue the project, and Roosevelt helped ensure that American scientists cooperated with their British counterparts.[278]', 'Roosevelt coined the term ""Four Policemen"" to refer to the ""Big Four"" Allied powers of World War II: the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and China. The ""Big Three"" of Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, together with Chinese Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, cooperated informally on a plan in which American and British troops concentrated in the West; Soviet troops fought on the Eastern front; and Chinese, British and American troops fought in Asia and the Pacific. The United States also continued to send aid via the Lend-Lease program to the Soviet Union and other countries. The Allies formulated strategy in a series of high-profile conferences as well as by contact through diplomatic and military channels.[279] Beginning in May 1942, the Soviets urged an Anglo-American invasion of German-occupied France to divert troops from the Eastern front.[280] Concerned that their forces were not yet ready, Churchill and Roosevelt decided to delay such an invasion until at least 1943 and instead focus on a landing in North Africa, known as Operation Torch.[281]', 'In November 1943, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin met to discuss strategy and post-war plans at the Tehran Conference, where Roosevelt met Stalin for the first time.[282] Britain and the United States committed to opening a second front against Germany in 1944, while Stalin committed to entering the war against Japan at an unspecified date. Subsequent conferences at Bretton Woods and Dumbarton Oaks established the framework for the post-war international monetary system and the United Nations, an intergovernmental organization similar to the failed League of Nations.[283] Taking up the Wilsonian mantle, Roosevelt pushed the establishment of the United Nations as his highest postwar priority. Roosevelt expected it would be controlled by Washington, Moscow, London and Beijing, and would resolve all major world problems.[284]', ""Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin met for a second time at the February 1945 Yalta Conference in Crimea. With the end of the war in Europe approaching, Roosevelt's primary focus was convincing Stalin to enter the war against Japan; the Joint Chiefs had estimated that an American invasion of Japan would cause as many as one million American casualties. In return, the Soviet Union was promised control of Asian territories such as Sakhalin Island. The three leaders agreed to hold a conference in 1945 to establish the United Nations, and they also agreed on the structure of the United Nations Security Council, which would be charged with ensuring international security. Roosevelt did not push for the immediate evacuation of Soviet soldiers from Poland, but he won the issuance of the Declaration on Liberated Europe, which promised free elections in countries that had been occupied by Germany. Germany itself would not be dismembered but would be jointly occupied by the United States, France, Britain, and the Soviet Union.[285] Against Soviet pressure, Roosevelt and Churchill refused to consent to impose huge reparations and deindustrialization on Germany after the war.[286] Roosevelt's role in the Yalta Conference has been controversial; critics charge that he naively trusted the Soviet Union to allow free elections in Eastern Europe, while supporters argue that there was little more that Roosevelt could have done for the Eastern European countries given the Soviet occupation and the need for cooperation with the Soviet Union.[287][288]"", 'The Allies invaded French North Africa in November 1942, securing the surrender of Vichy French forces within days of landing.[289] At the January 1943 Casablanca Conference, the Allies agreed to defeat Axis forces in North Africa and then launch an invasion of Sicily, with an attack on France to take place in 1944. At the conference, Roosevelt also announced that he would only accept the unconditional surrender of Germany, Japan, and Italy.[290] In February 1943, the Soviet Union won a major victory at the Battle of Stalingrad, and in May 1943, the Allies secured the surrender of over 250,000 German and Italian soldiers in North Africa, ending the North African Campaign.[291] The Allies launched an invasion of Sicily in July 1943, capturing the island the following month.[292] In September 1943, the Allies secured an armistice from Italian prime minister Pietro Badoglio, but Germany quickly restored Mussolini to power.[292] The Allied invasion of mainland Italy commenced in September 1943, but the Italian Campaign continued until 1945 as German and Italian troops resisted the Allied advance.[293]', ""To command the invasion of France, Roosevelt chose General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who had successfully commanded a multinational coalition in North Africa and Sicily.[294] Eisenhower launched Operation Overlord on June 6, 1944. Supported by 12,000 aircraft and the largest naval force ever assembled, the Allies successfully established a beachhead in Normandy and then advanced further into France.[274] Though reluctant to back an unelected government, Roosevelt recognized Charles de Gaulle's Provisional Government of the French Republic as the de facto government of France in July 1944. After most of France had been liberated, Roosevelt granted formal recognition to de Gaulle's government in October 1944.[295] Over the following months, the Allies liberated more territory and began the invasion of Germany. By April 1945, Nazi resistance was crumbling in the face of advances by both the Western Allies and the Soviet Union.[296]"", 'In the opening weeks of the war, Japan conquered the Philippines and the British and Dutch colonies in Southeast Asia. The Japanese advance reached its maximum extent by June 1942, when the U.S. Navy scored a decisive victory at the Battle of Midway. American and Australian forces then began a slow and costly strategy called island hopping or leapfrogging through the Pacific Islands, with the objective of gaining bases from which strategic airpower could be brought to bear on Japan and from which Japan could ultimately be invaded. In contrast to Hitler, Roosevelt took no direct part in the tactical naval operations, though he approved strategic decisions.[297] Roosevelt gave way in part to insistent demands from the public and Congress that more effort be devoted against Japan, but he always insisted on Germany first. The strength of the Japanese navy was decimated in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, and by April 1945 the Allies had re-captured much of their lost territory in the Pacific.[298]', 'The home front was subject to dynamic social changes throughout the war, though domestic issues were no longer Roosevelt\'s most urgent policy concern. The military buildup spurred economic growth. Unemployment fell from 7.7\xa0million in spring 1940 to 3.4\xa0million in fall 1941 and to 1.5\xa0million in fall 1942, out of a labor force of 54\xa0million.[m] There was a growing labor shortage, accelerating the second wave of the Great Migration of African Americans, farmers and rural populations to manufacturing centers. African Americans from the South went to California and other West Coast states for new jobs in the defense industry. To pay for increased government spending, in 1941 Roosevelt proposed that Congress enact an income tax rate of 99.5% on all income over $100,000; when the proposal failed, he issued an executive order imposing an income tax of 100% on income over $25,000, which Congress rescinded.[300] The Revenue Act of 1942 instituted top tax rates as high as 94% (after accounting for the excess profits tax), greatly increased the tax base, and instituted the first federal withholding tax.[301] In 1944, Roosevelt requested that Congress enact legislation to tax all ""unreasonable"" profits, both corporate and individual, and thereby support his declared need for over $10\xa0billion in revenue for the war and other government measures. Congress overrode Roosevelt\'s veto to pass a smaller revenue bill raising $2\xa0billion.[302]', 'In 1942, war production increased dramatically but fell short of Roosevelt\'s goals, due in part to manpower shortages.[303] The effort was also hindered by numerous strikes, especially in the coal mining and railroad industries, which lasted well into 1944.[304][305] Nonetheless, between 1941 and 1945, the United States produced 2.4\xa0million trucks, 300,000 military aircraft, 88,400 tanks, and 40\xa0billion rounds of ammunition. The production capacity of the United States dwarfed that of other countries; for example, in 1944, the United States produced more military aircraft than the combined production of Germany, Japan, Britain, and the Soviet Union.[306] The White House became the ultimate site for labor mediation, conciliation or arbitration. One particular battle royale occurred between Vice President Wallace, who headed the Board of Economic Warfare, and Jesse H. Jones, in charge of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation; both agencies assumed responsibility for the acquisition of rubber supplies and came to loggerheads over funding. Roosevelt resolved the dispute by dissolving both agencies.[307] In 1943, Roosevelt established the Office of War Mobilization to oversee the home front; the agency was led by James F. Byrnes, who came to be known as the ""assistant president"" due to his influence.[292]', 'Roosevelt\'s 1944 State of the Union Address advocated that Americans should think of basic economic rights as a Second Bill of Rights.[308] He stated that all Americans should have the right to ""adequate medical care"", ""a good education"", ""a decent home"", and a ""useful and remunerative job"".[309] In the most ambitious domestic proposal of his third term, Roosevelt proposed the G.I. Bill, which would create a massive benefits program for returning soldiers. Benefits included post-secondary education, medical care, unemployment insurance, job counseling, and low-cost loans for homes and businesses. The G.I. Bill passed unanimously in both houses of Congress and was signed into law in June 1944. Of the fifteen million Americans who served in World War II, more than half benefitted from the educational opportunities provided for in the G.I. Bill.[310]', 'Roosevelt, a chain-smoker throughout his adult life,[311][312] had been in declining health since at least 1940. In March 1944, shortly after his 62nd birthday, he underwent testing at Bethesda Hospital and was found to have hypertension, atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease causing angina pectoris, and congestive heart failure.[313][314][315]', 'Hospital physicians and two outside specialists ordered Roosevelt to rest. His personal physician, Admiral Ross McIntire, created a daily schedule that banned business guests for lunch and incorporated two hours of rest daily. During the 1944 re-election campaign, McIntire denied several times that Roosevelt\'s health was poor; on October 12, for example, he announced that ""The President\'s health is perfectly OK. There are absolutely no organic difficulties at all.""[316] Roosevelt realized that his declining health could eventually make it impossible for him to continue as president, and in 1945 he told a confidant that he might resign from the presidency following the end of the war.[317]', ""While some Democrats had opposed Roosevelt's nomination in 1940, the president faced little difficulty in securing his re-nomination at the 1944 Democratic National Convention. Roosevelt made it clear before the convention that he was seeking another term, and on the lone presidential ballot of the convention, Roosevelt won the vast majority of delegates, although a minority of Southern Democrats voted for Harry F. Byrd. Party leaders prevailed upon Roosevelt to drop Vice President Wallace from the ticket, believing him to be an electoral liability and a poor potential successor in case of Roosevelt's death. Roosevelt preferred Byrnes as Wallace's replacement but was convinced to support Senator Harry S. Truman of Missouri, who had earned renown for his investigation of war production inefficiency and was acceptable to the various factions of the party. On the second vice presidential ballot of the convention, Truman defeated Wallace to win the nomination.[318]"", 'The Republicans nominated Thomas E. Dewey, the governor of New York, who had a reputation as a liberal in his party. They accused the Roosevelt administration of domestic corruption and bureaucratic inefficiency, but Dewey\'s most effective gambit was to raise discreetly the age issue. He assailed the President as a ""tired old man"" with ""tired old men"" in his cabinet, pointedly suggesting that the President\'s lack of vigor had produced a less than vigorous economic recovery.[132] Roosevelt, as most observers could see from his weight loss and haggard appearance, was a tired man in 1944. But upon entering the campaign in earnest in late September 1944, Roosevelt displayed enough passion to allay most concerns and deflect Republican attacks. With the war still raging, he urged voters not to ""change horses in mid-stream"".[132] Labor unions, which had grown rapidly in the war, fully supported Roosevelt. Roosevelt and Truman won the 1944 election, defeating Dewey and his running mate John W. Bricker with 53.4% of the popular vote and 432 out of the 531 electoral votes.[319] The president campaigned in favor of a strong United Nations, so his victory symbolized support for the nation\'s future participation in the international community.[320]', 'When Roosevelt returned to the United States from the Yalta Conference, many were shocked to see how old, thin and frail he looked. He spoke while seated in the well of the House, an unprecedented concession to his physical incapacity.[321] During March 1945, he sent strongly worded messages to Stalin accusing him of breaking his Yalta commitments over Poland, Germany, prisoners of war and other issues. When Stalin accused the Western Allies of plotting behind his back a separate peace with Hitler, Roosevelt replied: ""I cannot avoid a feeling of bitter resentment towards your informers, whoever they are, for such vile misrepresentations of my actions or those of my trusted subordinates.""[322] On March 29, 1945, Roosevelt departed for the Little White House in Warm Springs, Georgia, to rest before his anticipated appearance at the founding conference of the United Nations.[323]', 'In the afternoon of April 12, 1945, in Warm Springs, Georgia, while sitting for a portrait by Elizabeth Shoumatoff, Roosevelt said: ""I have a terrific headache.""[323][324] He then slumped forward in his chair, unconscious, and was carried into his bedroom. The president\'s attending cardiologist, Howard Bruenn, diagnosed a massive intracerebral hemorrhage.[325] At 3:35\xa0p.m., Roosevelt died at the age of 63.[326]', ""The following morning, Roosevelt's body was placed in a flag-draped coffin and loaded onto the presidential train for the trip back to Washington.[327] Thousands flocked to the route to pay their respects. After a White House funeral on April 14, Roosevelt was transported by train from Washington to his birthplace at Hyde Park. On April 15 he was buried, per his wish, in the rose garden of his Springwood estate.[328]"", ""Roosevelt's declining physical health had been kept secret from the public. His death was met with shock and grief across the world.[329] Germany surrendered during the 30-day mourning period, but Harry Truman (who had succeeded Roosevelt as president) ordered flags to remain at half-staff; he also dedicated Victory in Europe Day and its celebrations to Roosevelt's memory.[330] World War II ended with the signed surrender of Japan in September.[331]"", 'Roosevelt was viewed as a hero by many African Americans, Catholics, and Jews, and he was highly successful in attracting large majorities of these voters into his New Deal coalition.[332] From his first term until 1939, the Mexican Repatriation started by President Herbert Hoover continued under Roosevelt, which scholars today contend was a form of ethnic cleansing towards Mexican Americans. Roosevelt ended federal involvement in the deportations. After 1934, deportations fell by approximately 50 percent.[333] However, Roosevelt did not attempt to suppress the deportations on a local or state level.[334][335] Mexican Americans were the only group explicitly excluded from New Deal benefits. The deprival of due process for Mexican Americans is cited as a precedent for Roosevelt\'s internment of Japanese Americans in concentration camps during World War II.[336] Roosevelt won strong support from Chinese Americans and Filipino Americans, but not Japanese Americans, as he presided over their internment during the war.[337] African Americans and Native Americans fared well in two New Deal relief programs, the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Indian Reorganization Act, respectively. Sitkoff reports that the WPA ""provided an economic floor for the whole black community in the 1930s, rivaling both agriculture and domestic service as the chief source"" of income.[338]', 'In contrast to Presidents Harding and Coolidge, Roosevelt stopped short of joining NAACP leaders in pushing for federal anti-lynching legislation. He asserted that such legislation was unlikely to pass and that his support for it would alienate Southern congressmen, though by 1940 even his conservative Texan vice-president, Garner, supported federal action against lynching.[339]', 'Roosevelt did not appoint or nominate a single African American as secretary or assistant secretary to his cabinet. About one hundred African Americans met informally, however, to provide the administration with advice on issues related to African Americans. Although sometimes described as a ""Black Cabinet"", Roosevelt never officially acknowledged it as such nor did he make ""appointments"" to it.[340]', ""First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt vocally supported efforts designed to aid the African American community, including the Fair Labor Standards Act, which helped boost wages for nonwhite workers in the South.[341] In 1941, Roosevelt established the Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC) to implement Executive Order 8802, which prohibited racial and religious discrimination in employment among defense contractors. The FEPC was the first national program directed against employment discrimination, and it played a major role in opening up new employment opportunities to nonwhite workers. During World War II, the proportion of African American men employed in manufacturing positions rose significantly.[342] In response to Roosevelt's policies, African Americans increasingly defected from the Republican Party during the 1930s and 1940s, becoming an important Democratic voting bloc in several Northern states.[340]"", 'The attack on Pearl Harbor raised concerns among the public regarding the possibility of sabotage by Japanese Americans. This suspicion was fed by long-standing racism against Japanese immigrants and the findings of the Roberts Commission, which concluded that the attack on Pearl Harbor had been assisted by Japanese spies. On February 19, 1942, Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which relocated 110,000 Japanese-American citizens and immigrants, most of whom lived on the Pacific Coast.[152] They were forced to liquidate their properties and businesses and interned in hastily built camps in interior, harsh locations.', 'Roosevelt delegated the decision for internment to Secretary of War Stimson, who in turn relied on the judgment of Assistant Secretary of War John J. McCloy. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the executive order in the 1944 case of Korematsu v. United States.[343] A much smaller number of German and Italian citizens were arrested or placed into internment camps. Unlike Japanese Americans, however, they were not sent to them on the sole basis of racial ancestry.[344][345]', 'There is controversy among historians about Roosevelt\'s attitude to Jews and the Holocaust. Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. says Roosevelt ""did what he could do"" to help Jews; David Wyman says Roosevelt\'s record on Jewish refugees and their rescue is ""very poor"" and one of the worst failures of his presidency.[346] In 1923, as a member of the Harvard University board of directors, Roosevelt decided there were too many Jewish students at Harvard and helped institute a quota to limit the number of Jews admitted.[347] After Kristallnacht in 1938, Roosevelt had his ambassador to Germany recalled to Washington. He did not loosen immigration quotas but did allow German Jews already in the U.S. on visas to stay indefinitely.[348] According to Rafael Medoff, Roosevelt could have saved 190,000 Jewish lives by telling his State Department to fill immigration quotas to the legal limit, but his administration discouraged and disqualified Jewish refugees based on its prohibitive requirements that left less than 25% of the quotas filled.[347]', 'Adolf Hitler chose to implement the ""Final Solution""—the extermination of the European Jewish population—by January 1942, and American officials learned of the scale of the Nazi extermination campaign in the following months. Against the objections of the State Department, Roosevelt convinced the other Allied leaders to issue the Joint Declaration by Members of the United Nations, which condemned the ongoing Holocaust and warned to try its perpetrators as war criminals. In 1943, Roosevelt told U.S. government officials that there should be limits on Jews in various professions to ""eliminate the specific and understandable complaints which the Germans bore towards the Jews in Germany.""[347] The same year, Roosevelt was personally briefed by Polish Home Army intelligence agent Jan Karski who was an eyewitness of the Holocaust; pleading for action, Karski told him that 1.8 million Jews had already been exterminated.[349][350] Karski recalled that Roosevelt ""did not ask one question about the Jews"".[351] In January 1944, Roosevelt established the War Refugee Board to aid Jews and other victims of Axis atrocities. Aside from these actions, Roosevelt believed that the best way to help the persecuted populations of Europe was to end the war as quickly as possible. Top military leaders and War Department leaders rejected any campaign to bomb the extermination camps or the rail lines leading to them, fearing it would be a diversion from the war effort. According to biographer Jean Edward Smith, there is no evidence that anyone ever proposed such a campaign to Roosevelt.[352]', 'Roosevelt is widely considered to be one of the most important figures in U.S. history,[353] and one of the most influential figures of the 20th century.[354] Historians and political scientists consistently rank Roosevelt, George Washington, and Abraham Lincoln as the three greatest presidents, although the order varies.[355][356][357][358] Reflecting on Roosevelt\'s presidency, ""which brought the United States through the Great Depression and World War II to a prosperous future"", biographer Jean Edward Smith said in 2007, ""He lifted himself from a wheelchair to lift the nation from its knees.""[359]', ""His commitment to the working class and unemployed in need of relief in the nation's longest recession made him a favorite of blue-collar workers, labor unions, and ethnic minorities.[360] The rapid expansion of government programs that occurred during Roosevelt's term redefined the role of government in the United States, and Roosevelt's advocacy for government social programs was instrumental in redefining liberalism for coming generations.[361] Roosevelt firmly established U.S. leadership on the world stage with his role in shaping and financing World War II. His isolationist critics faded away, and even the Republicans joined in his overall policies.[362] He also permanently increased the power of the president at the expense of Congress.[363]"", 'His Second Bill of Rights became, according to historian Joshua Zeitz, ""the basis of the Democratic Party\'s aspirations for the better part of four decades"".[309] After his death, Eleanor continued to be a forceful presence in U.S. and world politics, serving as delegate to the conference which established the United Nations and championing civil rights and liberalism generally. Some junior New Dealers played leading roles in the presidencies of Truman, John Kennedy, and Lyndon Johnson. Kennedy came from a Roosevelt-hating family. Historian William Leuchtenburg says that before 1960, ""Kennedy showed a conspicuous lack of inclination to identify himself as a New Deal liberal."" He adds, as president, ""Kennedy never wholly embraced the Roosevelt tradition and at times he deliberately severed himself from it.""[364] By contrast, young Lyndon Johnson had been an enthusiastic New Dealer and a favorite of Roosevelt. Johnson modelled his presidency on Roosevelt\'s.[365][366]', ""During his presidency, and continuing to a lesser extent afterwards, there has been much criticism of Roosevelt, some of it intense. Critics have questioned not only his policies, positions, and the consolidation of power that occurred due to his responses to the Depression and World War II but also his breaking with tradition by running for a third term as president.[367] Long after his death, new lines of attack criticized Roosevelt's policies regarding helping the Jews of Europe,[368] incarcerating the Japanese on the West Coast,[369] and opposing anti-lynching legislation.[370]"", 'Roosevelt was criticized by conservatives for his economic policies, especially the shift in tone from individualism to collectivism with the expansion of the welfare state and regulation of the economy. Those criticisms continued decades after his death. One factor in the revisiting of these issues was the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980, who opposed the New Deal.[371][372]', ""Roosevelt's home in Hyde Park is now a National Historic Site and home to his Presidential library. Washington, D.C., hosts two memorials: the 7+1⁄2-acre (3-hectare) Roosevelt Memorial, located next to the Jefferson Memorial on the Tidal Basin,[373] and a more modest memorial, a block of marble in front of the National Archives building suggested by Roosevelt himself, erected in 1965.[374] Roosevelt's leadership in the March of Dimes is one reason he is commemorated on the American dime.[375] Roosevelt has also appeared on several U.S. Postage stamps.[376] On April 29, 1945, seventeen days after Roosevelt's death, the carrier USS Franklin D. Roosevelt was launched and served from 1945 to 1977.[377] London's Westminster Abbey also has a stone tablet memorial to Roosevelt that was unveiled by Attlee and Churchill in 1948.[378] Welfare Island was renamed after Roosevelt in September 1973.[379]""]","Franklin Delano Roosevelt[a] (January 30, 1882 – April 12, 1945), also known as FDR, was the 32nd president of the United States, serving from 1933 until his death in 1945. The longest-serving U.S. president, he is the only president to have served more than two terms. His initial two terms were centered on combating the Great Depression, while his third and fourth saw him shift his focus to America's involvement in World War II.","Here is the text with the information related to President Roosevelt's actions regarding the Holocaust and his impact on the US and the world condensed:

Winston_Churchill,"['Sir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill[a] (30 November 1874 – 24 January 1965) was a British statesman, military officer, and writer who was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1940 to 1945 (during the Second World War) and again from 1951 to 1955. Apart from 1922 to 1924, he was a member of Parliament (MP) from 1900 to 1964 and represented a total of five constituencies. Ideologically an adherent to economic liberalism and imperialism, he was for most of his career a member of the Conservative Party, which he led from 1940 to 1955. He was a member of the Liberal Party from 1904 to 1924.', ""Of mixed English and American parentage, Churchill was born in Oxfordshire into the wealthy, aristocratic Spencer family. He joined the British Army in 1895 and saw action in British India, the Mahdist War and the Second Boer War, gaining fame as a war correspondent and writing books about his campaigns. Elected a Conservative MP in 1900, he defected to the Liberals in 1904. In H. H. Asquith's Liberal government, Churchill was president of the Board of Trade and Home Secretary, championing prison reform and workers' social security. As First Lord of the Admiralty during the First World War, he oversaw the Gallipoli campaign, but after it proved a disaster, was demoted to Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He resigned in November 1915 and joined the Royal Scots Fusiliers on the Western Front for six months. In 1917, he returned to government under David Lloyd George and served successively as Minister of Munitions, Secretary of State for War, Secretary of State for Air, and Secretary of State for the Colonies, overseeing the Anglo-Irish Treaty and British foreign policy in the Middle East. After two years out of Parliament, he was Chancellor of the Exchequer in Stanley Baldwin's Conservative government, returning sterling in 1925 to the gold standard, depressing the UK economy."", 'Out of government during his so-called ""wilderness years"" in the 1930s, Churchill took the lead in calling for rearmament to counter the threat of militarism in Nazi Germany. At the outbreak of the Second World War he was re-appointed First Lord of the Admiralty. In May 1940, he became prime minister, succeeding Neville Chamberlain. Churchill formed a national government and oversaw British involvement in the Allied war effort against the Axis powers, resulting in victory in 1945. After the Conservatives\' defeat in the 1945 general election, he became Leader of the Opposition. Amid the developing Cold War with the Soviet Union, he publicly warned of an ""iron curtain"" of Soviet influence in Europe and promoted European unity. Between his terms, he wrote several books recounting his experience during the war. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1953. He lost the 1950 election but was returned to office in 1951. His second term was preoccupied with foreign affairs, especially Anglo-American relations and preservation of what remained of the British Empire, with India no longer a part of it. Domestically, his government\'s priority was their extensive housebuilding programme, in which they were successful. In declining health, Churchill resigned in 1955, remaining an MP until 1964. Upon his death in 1965, he was given a state funeral.', ""One of the 20th century's most significant figures, Churchill remains popular in the UK and the rest of the Anglosphere. He is generally viewed as a victorious wartime leader who played an integral role in defending liberal democracy against the spread of fascism. He has sometimes been criticised for his imperialism and certain comments on race, in addition to some wartime decisions such as area bombing, but historians nevertheless rank Churchill as one of the greatest British prime ministers."", ""Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill was born on 30 November 1874 at his family's ancestral home, Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire.[2] On his father's side, he was a member of the aristocracy as a descendant of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough.[3] His father, Lord Randolph Churchill, representing the Conservative Party, had been elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Woodstock in February 1874.[4] His mother, Jennie, was a daughter of Leonard Jerome, an American businessman.[5]"", 'In 1876, Churchill\'s paternal grandfather, John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough, was appointed Viceroy of Ireland. Randolph became his private secretary and the family relocated to Dublin.[6] Winston\'s brother, Jack, was born there in 1880.[7] For much of the 1880s, Randolph and Jennie were effectively estranged,[8] and the brothers cared for by their nanny, Elizabeth Everest.[9] When she died in 1895, Churchill wrote ""she had been my dearest and most intimate friend during the whole of the twenty years I had lived"".[10]', ""Churchill began boarding school at St George's in Ascot, Berkshire, aged 7, but he was not academic and his behaviour was poor.[11] In 1884, he transferred to Brunswick School in Hove, where his academic performance improved.[12] In April 1888, aged 13, he passed the entrance exam for Harrow School.[13] His father wanted him to prepare for a military career, so his last three years at Harrow were in the army form.[14] After two unsuccessful attempts to gain admittance to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, he succeeded.[15] He was accepted as a cadet in the cavalry, starting in September 1893.[16] His father died in January 1895.[17]"", 'In February 1895, Churchill was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 4th Queen\'s Own Hussars regiment of the British Army, based at Aldershot.[19] Eager to witness military action, he used his mother\'s influence to get posted to a war zone.[20] In the autumn, he and friend Reggie Barnes, went to observe the Cuban War of Independence and became involved in skirmishes after joining Spanish troops attempting to suppress independence fighters.[21] Churchill sent reports to the Daily Graphic in London.[22] He proceeded to New York and wrote to his mother about ""what an extraordinary people the Americans are!""[23] With the Hussars, he went to Bombay in October 1896.[24] Based in Bangalore, he was in India for 19 months, visiting Calcutta and joining expeditions to Hyderabad and the North West Frontier.[25]', 'In India, Churchill began a self-education project,[26] reading widely including Plato, Edward Gibbon, Charles Darwin and Thomas Babington Macaulay.[27] The books were sent by his mother, with whom he shared frequent correspondence. To learn about politics, he asked her to send him copies of The Annual Register, the political almanack.[28] In an 1898 letter, he referred to his beliefs, saying: ""I do not accept the Christian or any other form of religious belief"".[29] Churchill had been christened in the Church of England[30] but underwent a virulently anti-Christian phase in his youth,[31] and as an adult was an agnostic.[32] In another letter to a cousin, he referred to religion as ""a delicious narcotic"" and expressed a preference for Protestantism over Roman Catholicism because he felt it ""a step nearer Reason"".[33]', 'Interested in parliamentary affairs,[34] he declared himself ""a Liberal in all but name"", adding he could never endorse the Liberal Party\'s support for Irish home rule.[35] Instead, he allied himself to the Tory democracy wing of the Conservatives and on a visit home, gave his first speech for the party\'s Primrose League at Claverton Down.[36] Mixing reformist and conservative perspectives, he supported the promotion of secular, non-denominational education while opposing women\'s suffrage.[37]', 'Churchill volunteered to join Bindon Blood\'s Malakand Field Force in its campaign against Mohmand rebels in the Swat Valley of north-west India. Blood accepted on condition he was assigned as a journalist, the beginning of Churchill\'s writing career.[38] He returned to Bangalore in October 1897 and wrote his first book, The Story of the Malakand Field Force, which received positive reviews.[39] He wrote his only work of fiction, Savrola, a Ruritanian romance.[40] To keep occupied, Churchill embraced writing as what Roy Jenkins calls his ""whole habit"", especially through his career when he was out of office. Writing was his safeguard against recurring depression, which he referred to as his ""black dog"".[41]', ""Using London contacts, Churchill got attached to General Herbert Kitchener's campaign in the Sudan as a 21st Lancers subaltern while, working as a journalist for The Morning Post.[42] After fighting in the Battle of Omdurman in September 1898, the 21st Lancers were stood down.[43] In October, Churchill returned to England and began writing The River War, about the campaign published in 1899. He decided to leave the army[44] as he was critical of Kitchener's actions, particularly the unmerciful treatment of enemy wounded and his desecration of Muhammad Ahmad's tomb.[45]"", 'On 2 December 1898, Churchill embarked for India to settle his military business and complete his resignation. He spent much time playing polo, the only ball sport in which he was ever interested. Having left the Hussars, he sailed from Bombay on 20 March 1899, determined to launch a career in politics.[46]', 'Churchill spoke at Conservative meetings[48] and was selected as one of the party\'s two candidates for the June 1899 Oldham by-election.[49] While campaigning, Churchill referred to himself as ""a Conservative and a Tory Democrat"".[50] Although the seats had been held by the Conservatives, the result was a narrow Liberal victory.[51]', 'Anticipating the outbreak of the Second Boer War between Britain and the Boer republics, Churchill sailed to South Africa as a journalist for the Morning Post.[52][53] In October, he travelled to the conflict zone near Ladysmith, then besieged by Boer troops, before heading for Colenso.[54] At the Battle of Chieveley, his train was derailed by Boer artillery shelling, he was captured as a prisoner of war (POW) and interned in a POW camp in Pretoria.[55] In December, Churchill escaped and evaded his captors by stowing aboard freight trains and hiding in a mine. He made it to safety in Portuguese East Africa.[56] His escape attracted much publicity.[57]', 'In January 1900, he briefly rejoined the army as a lieutenant in the South African Light Horse regiment, joining Redvers Buller\'s fight to relieve the Siege of Ladysmith and take Pretoria.[58] He was among the first British troops into both places. He and cousin, Charles Spencer-Churchill, 9th Duke of Marlborough, demanded and received the surrender of 52 Boer prison camp guards.[59] Throughout the war, he publicly chastised anti-Boer prejudices, calling for them to be treated with ""generosity and tolerance"",[60] and afterwards urged the British to be magnanimous in victory.[61] In July, having resigned his lieutenancy, he returned to Britain. His Morning Post despatches had been published as London to Ladysmith via Pretoria and sold well.[62]', ""Churchill rented a flat in London's Mayfair, using it as his base for six years. He stood again as a Conservative candidate at Oldham in the October 1900 general election, securing a narrow victory to become a Member of Parliament aged 25.[63] In the same month, he published Ian Hamilton's March, a book about his South African experiences,[64][65] which became the focus of a lecture tour in November through Britain, America and Canada. Members of Parliament were unpaid and the tour was a financial necessity. In America, Churchill met Mark Twain, President McKinley and Vice President Theodore Roosevelt, who he did not get on with.[66] In spring 1901, he gave lectures in Paris, Madrid and Gibraltar.[67]"", 'In February 1901, Churchill took his seat in the House of Commons, where his maiden speech gained widespread coverage.[68] He associated with a group of Conservatives known as the Hughligans,[69] but was critical of the Conservative government on various issues, especially increases in army funding. He believed additional military expenditure should go to the navy.[70] This upset the Conservative front bench but was supported by Liberals, with whom he increasingly socialised, particularly Liberal Imperialists like H. H. Asquith.[71] Churchill later wrote that he ""drifted steadily to the left"".[72] He privately considered ""the gradual creation by an evolutionary process of a Democratic or Progressive wing to the Conservative Party"",[73] or alternately a ""Central Party"" to unite the Conservatives and Liberals.[74]', ""By 1903, there was division between Churchill and the Conservatives, largely because he opposed their promotion of protectionism. As a free trader, he helped found the Free Food League.[22] Churchill sensed that the animosity of party members would prevent him gaining a Cabinet position under a Conservative government. The Liberal Party was attracting growing support, and so his defection in 1904 may have been influenced by ambition.[75] He increasingly voted with the Liberals.[76] For example, he opposed an increase in military expenditure,[77] supported a Liberal bill to restore legal rights to trade unions,[76] and opposed the introduction of import tariffs.[78] Arthur Balfour's government announced protectionist legislation in October 1903.[79] Two months later, incensed by Churchill's criticism of the government, the Oldham Conservative Association informed him it would not support his candidature at the next election.[80]"", 'In May 1904, Churchill opposed the government\'s proposed Aliens Bill, designed to curb Jewish immigration.[81] He stated that the bill would ""appeal to insular prejudice against foreigners, to racial prejudice against Jews, and to labour prejudice against competition"" and expressed himself in favour of ""the old tolerant and generous practice of free entry and asylum to which this country has so long adhered and from which it has so greatly gained"".[81] On 31 May 1904, he crossed the floor to sit as a member of the Liberal Party.[82]', 'As a Liberal, Churchill attacked government policy and gained a reputation as a radical under the influences of John Morley and David Lloyd George.[22] In December 1905, Balfour resigned as prime minister and King Edward\xa0VII invited the Liberal leader Henry Campbell-Bannerman to replace him.[83] Hoping to secure a working majority, Campbell-Bannerman called a general election in January 1906, which the Liberals won in a massive landslide.[84] Churchill won the Manchester North West seat[85] and his biography of his father was published;[86] he received advance payment of £8,000.[87] It was generally well received.[88] The first biography of Churchill himself, written by the Liberal MacCallum Scott, was published.[89]', 'In the new government, Churchill became Under-Secretary of State for the Colonial Office, a junior ministerial position he had requested.[90] He worked beneath the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Victor Bruce, 9th Earl of Elgin,[91] and took Edward Marsh as his secretary; Marsh remained his secretary for 25 years.[92] Churchill\'s first task was helping to draft a constitution for the Transvaal;[93] and he helped oversee the formation of a government in the Orange River Colony.[94] In dealing with southern Africa, he sought to ensure equality between the British and Boers.[95] He announced a gradual phasing out of the use of Chinese indentured labourers in South Africa; he and the government decided a sudden ban would cause too much upset and might damage the colony\'s economy.[96] He expressed concerns about the relations between European settlers and the black African population; after the Zulu launched their Bambatha Rebellion in Natal, Churchill complained about the ""disgusting butchery of the natives"" by Europeans.[97]', 'With Campbell-Bannerman terminally ill, Asquith became prime minister in April 1908. He appointed Churchill as President of the Board of Trade.[98] Aged 33, Churchill was the youngest Cabinet member since 1866.[99] Newly appointed Cabinet ministers were legally obliged to seek re-election at a by-election. On 24 April, Churchill lost the Manchester North West by-election to the Conservative candidate by 429 votes.[100] On 9 May, the Liberals stood him in the safe seat of Dundee, where he won comfortably.[101]', ""Churchill proposed marriage to Clementine Hozier; they were married on 12 September 1908 at St Margaret's, Westminster and honeymooned in Baveno, Venice, and Veveří Castle in Moravia.[102][103] They lived at 33 Eccleston Square, London, and their first daughter, Diana, was born in 1909.[104][105] The success of their marriage was important to Churchill's career as Clementine's unbroken affection provided him with a secure and happy background.[22]"", 'One of Churchill\'s first tasks as a minister was to arbitrate in an industrial dispute among ship-workers and employers, on the River Tyne.[106] He afterwards established a Standing Court of Arbitration to deal with industrial disputes,[107] establishing a reputation as a conciliator.[108] He worked with Lloyd George to champion social reform.[109] He promoted what he called a ""network of State intervention and regulation"" akin to that in Germany.[110]', ""Continuing Lloyd George's work,[22] Churchill introduced the Mines Eight Hours Bill, which prohibited miners from working more than an eight-hour day.[111] In 1909, he introduced the Trade Boards Bill, creating Trade Boards which could prosecute exploitative employers. Passing with a large majority, it established the principle of a minimum wage and the right to have meal breaks.[112] In May 1909, he proposed the Labour Exchanges Bill to establish over 200 Labour Exchanges through which the unemployed would be assisted in finding employment.[113] He promoted the idea of an unemployment insurance scheme, which would be part-funded by the state.[114]"", 'To ensure funding for their reforms, Lloyd George and Churchill denounced Reginald McKenna\'s policy of naval expansion,[115] refusing to believe war with Germany was inevitable.[116] As Chancellor, Lloyd George presented his ""People\'s Budget"" on 29 April 1909, calling it a war budget to eliminate poverty. With Churchill as his closest ally,[22] Lloyd George proposed unprecedented taxes on the rich to fund Liberal welfare programmes.[117] The budget was vetoed by the Conservative peers who dominated the House of Lords.[118] His social reforms under threat, Churchill became president of the Budget League,[22] and warned that upper-class obstruction could anger working-class Britons and lead to class war.[119] The government called the January 1910 general election, which resulted in a Liberal victory; Churchill retained his seat at Dundee.[120] He proposed abolition of the House of Lords in a cabinet memo, suggesting it be succeeded by a unicameral system, or smaller second chamber that lacked an in-built advantage for the Conservatives.[121] In April, the Lords relented and the People\'s Budget passed.[122] Churchill continued to campaign against the House of Lords and assisted passage of the Parliament Act 1911 which reduced and restricted its powers.[22]', 'In February 1910, Churchill was promoted to Home Secretary, giving him control over the police and prison services;[123] he implemented a prison reform programme.[124] Measures included a distinction between criminal and political prisoners, with rules for the latter being relaxed.[125] There were educational innovations like the establishment of libraries,[126] and a requirement to stage entertainments four times a year.[127] The rules on solitary confinement were relaxed,[128] and Churchill proposed abolition of automatic imprisonment of those who failed to pay fines.[129] Imprisonment of people aged between 16 and 21 was abolished except for the most serious offences.[130] Churchill reduced (""commuted"") 21 of the 43 death (""capital"") sentences passed while he was Home Secretary.[131]', ""A major domestic issue was women's suffrage. Churchill supported giving women the vote, but would only back a bill to that effect if it had majority support from the (male) electorate.[132] His proposed solution was a referendum, but this found no favour with Asquith and women's suffrage remained unresolved until 1918.[133] Many suffragettes believed Churchill was a committed opponent,[134] and targeted his meetings for protest.[133] In November 1910, the suffragist Hugh Franklin attacked Churchill with a whip; Franklin was imprisoned for six weeks.[134]"", 'In November 1910, Churchill had to deal with the Tonypandy riots, in which coal miners in the Rhondda Valley violently protested against working conditions.[135] The Chief Constable of Glamorgan requested troops to help police quell the rioting. Churchill, learning that the troops were already travelling, allowed them to go as far as Swindon and Cardiff, but blocked their deployment; he was concerned their use lead to bloodshed. Instead he sent 270 London police, who were not equipped with firearms, to assist.[135] As the riots continued, he offered the protesters an interview with the government\'s chief industrial arbitrator, which they accepted.[136] Privately, Churchill regarded the mine owners and striking miners as ""very unreasonable"".[134] The Times and other media outlets accused him of being soft on the rioters;[137] in contrast, many in the Labour Party, which was linked to the trade unions, regarded him as too heavy-handed.[138] Churchill incurred the long-term suspicion of the labour movement.[22]', 'Asquith called a general election in December 1910, and the Liberals were re-elected with Churchill secure in Dundee.[139] In January 1911, Churchill became involved in the Siege of Sidney Street; three Latvian burglars had killed police officers and hidden in a house in the East End of London, surrounded by police.[140] Churchill stood with the police though he did not direct their operation.[141] After the house caught fire, he told the fire brigade not to proceed into the house because of the threat posed by the armed men. Afterwards, two of the burglars were found dead.[141] Although he faced criticism for his decision, he said he ""thought it better to let the house burn down rather than spend good British lives in rescuing those ferocious rascals"".[142]', ""In March 1911, Churchill introduced the second reading of the Coal Mines Bill; when implemented, it imposed stricter safety standards.[143] He formulated the Shops Bill to improve working conditions of shop workers; it faced opposition from shop owners and only passed in a much emasculated form.[144] In April, Lloyd George introduced the first health and unemployment insurance legislation, the National Insurance Act 1911, which Churchill had been instrumental in drafting.[144] In May, Clementine gave birth to their second child, Randolph, named after Winston's father.[145] In response to escalating civil strife in 1911, Churchill sent troops into Liverpool to quell protesting dockers and rallied against a national railway strike.[146]"", 'During the Agadir Crisis of April 1911, when there was a threat of war between France and Germany, Churchill suggested an alliance with France and Russia to safeguard the independence of Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands to counter possible German expansionism.[147] The Crisis had a profound effect on Churchill and he altered his views about the need for naval expansion.[148]', 'In October 1911, Asquith appointed Churchill First Lord of the Admiralty,[149] and he took up official residence at Admiralty House.[150] He created a naval war staff[22] and, over the next two and a half years, focused on naval preparation, visiting naval stations and dockyards, seeking to improve morale, and scrutinising German naval developments.[151] After Germany passed its 1912 Naval Law to increase warship production, Churchill vowed that for every new German battleship, Britain would build two.[152] He invited Germany to engage in a mutual de-escalation, but this was refused.[153]', 'Churchill pushed for higher pay and greater recreational facilities for naval staff,[154] more submarines,[155] and a renewed focus on the Royal Naval Air Service, encouraging them to experiment with how aircraft could be used for military purposes.[156] He coined the term ""seaplane"" and ordered 100 to be constructed.[157] Some Liberals objected to his level of naval expenditure; in December 1913 he threatened to resign if his proposal for 4 new battleships in 1914–15 was rejected.[158] In June 1914, he convinced the House of Commons to authorise the government purchase of a 51% share in the profits of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, to secure oil access for the navy.[159]', 'The central issue in Britain was Irish Home Rule and, in 1912, Asquith\'s government introduced the Home Rule Bill.[160] Churchill supported it and urged Ulster Unionists to accept it as he opposed the Partition of Ireland.[161] Concerning the possibility of partition, Churchill stated: ""Whatever Ulster\'s right may be, she cannot stand in the way of the whole of the rest of Ireland. Half a province cannot impose a permanent veto on the nation. Half a province cannot obstruct forever the reconciliation between the British and Irish democracies"".[162] Speaking in the House of Commons on 16 February 1922, Churchill said: ""What Irishmen all over the world most desire is not hostility against this country, but the unity of their own"".[162]Following a Cabinet decision, he boosted the naval presence in Ireland to deal with any Unionist uprising.[163] Seeking a compromise, Churchill suggested Ireland remain part of a federal UK, but this angered Liberals and Irish nationalists.[164]', ""As First Lord, Churchill was tasked with overseeing Britain's naval effort when the First World War began in August 1914.[165] The navy transported 120,000 troops to France and began a blockade of Germany's North Sea ports. Churchill sent submarines to the Baltic Sea to assist the Russian Navy and sent the Marine Brigade to Ostend, forcing a reallocation of German troops.[166] In September, Churchill assumed full responsibility for Britain's aerial defence.[167] On 7 October, Clementine gave birth to their 3rd child, Sarah.[168] In October, Churchill visited Antwerp to observe Belgian defences against the besieging Germans and promised reinforcements.[169] Soon afterwards, Antwerp fell to the Germans and Churchill was criticised in the press.[170] He maintained that his actions had prolonged resistance and enabled the Allies to secure Calais and Dunkirk.[171] In November, Asquith called a War Council including Churchill.[172] Churchill set the development of the tank on the right track and financed its creation with Admiralty funds.[173]"", ""Churchill was interested in the Middle Eastern theatre, and wanted to relieve pressure on the Russians in the Caucasus by staging attacks against Turkey in the Dardanelles. He hoped that the British could even seize Constantinople.[174] Approval was given and, in March 1915, an Anglo-French task force attempted a naval bombardment of Turkish defences. In April, the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force, including the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC), began its assault at Gallipoli.[175] Both campaigns failed and Churchill was held by many MPs, particularly Conservatives, to be responsible.[176] In May, Asquith agreed under parliamentary pressure to form an all-party coalition government, but the Conservatives' condition of entry was that Churchill must be removed from the Admiralty.[177] Churchill pleaded his case with Asquith and Conservative leader Bonar Law but had to accept demotion.[178]"", 'On 25 November 1915, Churchill resigned from the government, although he remained an MP. Asquith rejected his request to be appointed Governor-General of British East Africa.[179] Churchill decided to return to active service with the Army and was attached to the 2nd Grenadier Guards, on the Western Front.[180] In January 1916, he was temporarily promoted to lieutenant-colonel and given command of the 6th Royal Scots Fusiliers.[181][182] The battalion was moved to a sector of the Belgian Front near Ploegsteert.[183] For three months, they faced continual shelling, though no German offensive.[184] Churchill narrowly escaped death when, during a visit by his cousin Marlborough, a large piece of shrapnel fell between them.[185] In May, the 6th Royal Scots Fusiliers were merged into the 15th Division. Churchill did not request a new command, instead securing permission to leave active service.[186] His temporary promotion ended on 16 May 1916, when he returned to the rank of major.[187]', 'Back in the House of Commons, Churchill spoke out on war issues, calling for conscription to be extended to the Irish, greater recognition of soldiers\' bravery, and for the introduction of steel helmets.[188] It was in November 1916 that he penned ""The greater application of mechanical power to the prosecution of an offensive on land"", but it fell on deaf ears.[189] He was frustrated at being out of office, but was repeatedly blamed for the Gallipoli disaster by the pro-Conservative press.[190] Churchill argued his case before the Dardanelles Commission, whose report placed no blame on him personally for the campaign\'s failure.[191]', ""In October 1916, Asquith resigned as prime minister and was succeeded by Lloyd George who, in May 1917, sent Churchill to inspect the French war effort.[192] In July, Churchill was appointed Minister of Munitions.[193] He negotiated an end to a strike in munitions factories along the Clyde and increased munitions production.[194] In his October 1917 letter to his Cabinet colleagues, he penned the plan of attack for the next year, that would bring final victory to the Allies.[189] He ended a second strike, in June 1918, by threatening to conscript strikers into the army.[195] In the House of Commons, Churchill voted in support of the Representation of the People Act 1918, which gave some women the right to vote.[196] In November 1918, four days after the Armistice, Churchill's fourth child, Marigold, was born.[197]"", 'Lloyd George called a general election for 14 December 1918.[198] During the campaign, Churchill called for nationalisation of the railways, a control on monopolies, tax reform, and the creation of a League of Nations to prevent wars.[199] He was returned as MP for Dundee and, though the Conservatives won a majority, Lloyd George was retained as prime minister.[199] In January 1919, Lloyd George moved Churchill to the War Office as both Secretary of State for War and Secretary of State for Air.[200]', ""Churchill was responsible for demobilising the army,[201] though he convinced Lloyd George to keep a million men conscripted for the British Army of the Rhine.[202] Churchill was one of the few government figures who opposed harsh measures against Germany,[197] and he cautioned against demobilising the German Army, warning they might be needed as a bulwark against Soviet Russia.[203] He was outspoken against Vladimir Lenin's Communist Party government in Russia.[204] He initially supported using British troops to assist the anti-Communist White forces in the Russian Civil War,[205] but soon recognised the people's desire to bring them home.[206] After the Soviets won the civil war, Churchill proposed a cordon sanitaire around the country.[207]"", 'In the Irish War of Independence, he supported the use of the paramilitary Black and Tans to combat Irish revolutionaries.[208] After British troops in Iraq clashed with Kurdish rebels, Churchill authorised two squadrons to the area, proposing they be equipped with ""poison gas"" to be used to ""inflict punishment upon recalcitrant natives without inflicting grave injury upon them"", although this was never implemented.[209] He saw the occupation of Iraq as a drain on Britain and proposed, unsuccessfully, that the government should hand control back to Turkey.[210]', ""Churchill became Secretary of State for the Colonies in February 1921.[211] The following month, the first exhibit of his paintings took place in Paris, with Churchill exhibiting under a pseudonym.[211] In May, his mother died, followed in August by his daughter Marigold, from sepsis.[212] Churchill was haunted by Marigold's death for the rest of his life.[213]"", 'Churchill was involved in negotiations with Sinn Féin leaders and helped draft the Anglo-Irish Treaty.[214] He was responsible for reducing the cost of occupying the Middle East,[211] and was involved in the installations of Faisal I of Iraq and Abdullah I of Jordan.[215] Churchill travelled to Mandatory Palestine where, as a supporter of Zionism, he refused an Arab Palestinian petition to prohibit Jewish migration.[216] He did allow temporary restrictions following the Jaffa riots.[217]', 'In September 1922, the Chanak Crisis erupted as Turkish forces threatened to occupy the Dardanelles neutral zone, which was policed by the British army based in Chanak. Churchill and Lloyd George favoured military resistance to any Turkish advance but the majority Conservatives in the coalition government opposed it. A political debacle ensued which resulted in the Conservative withdrawal from the government, precipitating the November 1922 general election.[22]', 'Also in September, Churchill\'s fifth and last child, Mary, was born, and in the same month he purchased Chartwell, in Kent, which became his family home.[218] In October 1922, he underwent an appendectomy. While he was in hospital, Lloyd George\'s coalition was dissolved. In the general election, Churchill lost his Dundee seat[219] to Edwin Scrymgeour, a prohibitionist candidate. Later, he wrote that he was ""without an office, without a seat, without a party, and without an appendix"".[220] He was elevated as one of 50 members of the Order of the Companions of Honour, as named in Lloyd George\'s 1922 Dissolution Honours list.[221]', ""Churchill spent much of the next six months at the Villa Rêve d'Or near Cannes, where he devoted himself to painting and writing his memoirs.[222] He wrote an autobiographical history of the war, The World Crisis. The first volume was published in April 1923 and the rest over the next ten years.[219] After the 1923 general election was called, seven Liberal associations asked Churchill to stand as their candidate, and he selected Leicester West, but did not win.[223] A Labour government led by Ramsay MacDonald took power. Churchill had hoped they would be defeated by a Conservative-Liberal coalition.[224] He strongly opposed the MacDonald government's decision to loan money to Soviet Russia and feared the signing of an Anglo-Soviet Treaty.[225]"", 'In March 1924, alienated by Liberal support for Labour, Churchill stood as an independent anti-socialist candidate in the Westminster Abbey by-election but was defeated.[226] In May, he addressed a Conservative meeting in Liverpool and declared there was no longer a place for the Liberal Party in politics. He said that Liberals must back the Conservatives to stop Labour and ensure ""the successful defeat of socialism"".[227] In July, he agreed with Conservative leader Stanley Baldwin that he would be selected as a Conservative candidate in the next general election, which was held on 29 October. Churchill stood at Epping, but described himself as a ""Constitutionalist"".[228] The Conservatives were victorious, and Baldwin formed the new government. Although Churchill had no background in finance or economics, Baldwin appointed him as Chancellor.[229]', ""Becoming Chancellor on 6 November 1924, Churchill formally rejoined the Conservative Party.[230] As Chancellor, he intended to pursue his free trade principles in the form of laissez-faire economics, as under the Liberal social reforms.[230] In April 1925, he controversially, albeit reluctantly, restored the gold standard in his first budget, at its 1914 parity, against the advice of leading economists including John Maynard Keynes.[231] The return to gold is held to have caused deflation and resultant unemployment with a devastating impact on the coal industry.[232] Churchill presented five budgets in all to April 1929. Among his measures were reduction of the state pension age from 70 to 65; immediate provision of widow's pensions; reduction of military expenditure; income tax reductions and imposition of taxes on luxury items.[233]"", 'During the General Strike of 1926, Churchill edited the British Gazette, the government\'s anti-strike propaganda newspaper.[234] After the strike ended, he acted as an intermediary between striking miners and their employers. He called for the introduction of a legally binding minimum wage.[235] In a House of Commons speech in 1926 Churchill made his feelings on the issue of Irish unity clear. He stated that Ireland should be united within itself but also ""united to the British Empire.""[236] In early 1927, Churchill visited Rome where he met Mussolini, whom he praised for his stand against Leninism.[237]', 'In the 1929 general election, Churchill retained his Epping seat, but the Conservatives were defeated, and MacDonald formed his second Labour government.[238] Out of office, Churchill was prone to depression (his ""black dog"") but addressed this by writing.[239] He began work on Marlborough: His Life and Times, a biography of his ancestor John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough.[240][241] He had developed a reputation for being a heavy drinker, although Jenkins believes that was often exaggerated.[242]', 'Hoping that the Labour government could be ousted, he gained Baldwin\'s approval to work towards establishing a Conservative-Liberal coalition, although many Liberals were reluctant.[240] In October 1930, after his return from a trip to North America, Churchill published his autobiography, My Early Life, which sold well and was translated into multiple languages.[243] In January 1931, Churchill resigned from the Conservative Shadow Cabinet because Baldwin supported the government\'s decision to grant Dominion Status to India.[244] Churchill believed that enhanced home rule status would hasten calls for full independence.[245] He was particularly opposed to Mohandas Gandhi, whom he considered ""a seditious Middle Temple lawyer, now posing as a fakir"".[246] His views enraged Labour and Liberal opinion, though he was supported by many grassroot Conservatives.[247]', 'The October 1931 general election was a landslide victory for the Conservatives.[248] Churchill nearly doubled his majority in Epping, but was not given a ministerial position.[249] The Commons debated Dominion Status for India on 3 December and Churchill insisted on dividing the House, but this backfired as only 43 MPs supported him.[250] He embarked on a lecture tour of North America, hoping to recoup financial losses sustained in the Wall Street Crash.[248][250] On 13 December, he was crossing Fifth Avenue in New York when he was knocked down by a car, suffering a head wound from which he developed neuritis.[251] To further his convalescence, he and Clementine took ship to Nassau for three weeks, but Churchill became depressed about his financial and political losses.[252] He returned to America in late January 1932 and completed most of his lectures before arriving home on 18 March.[252]', 'Having worked on Marlborough for much of 1932, Churchill in August decided to visit his ancestor\'s battlefields.[253] In Munich, he met Ernst Hanfstaengl, a friend of Hitler, who was then rising in prominence. Hanfstaengl tried to arrange a meeting between Churchill and Hitler, but Hitler was unenthusiastic: ""What on earth would I talk to him about?""[254] Soon after visiting Blenheim, Churchill was affected by paratyphoid fever and spent two weeks at a sanatorium in Salzburg.[255] He returned to Chartwell on 25 September, still working on Marlborough. Two days later, he collapsed after a recurrence of paratyphoid which caused an ulcer to haemorrhage. He was taken to a London nursing home and remained there until late October.[256]', 'After Hitler came to power in January 1933, Churchill was quick to recognise the menace of such a regime, and expressed alarm that the British government had reduced air force spending, and warned that Germany would soon overtake Britain in air force production.[257][258] Armed with data provided clandestinely by senior civil servants, Desmond Morton and Ralph Wigram, Churchill was able to speak with authority about what was happening in Germany, especially the development of the Luftwaffe.[259] He spoke of his concerns in a radio broadcast in November 1934,[260] having denounced the intolerance and militarism of Nazism in the House of Commons.[261] While Churchill regarded Mussolini\'s regime as a bulwark against the threat of communist revolution, he opposed the Italian invasion of Ethiopia,[262] despite describing the country as a primitive, uncivilised nation.[263] He admired the exiled king of Spain Alfonso XIII and feared Communism was making inroads during the Spanish Civil War.  He referred to Franco\'s army as the ""anti-red movement"", but later became critical of Franco as too close to Mussolini and Hitler.[264][265]', 'Between October 1933 and September 1938, the four volumes of Marlborough: His Life and Times were published and sold well.[266] In December 1934, the India Bill entered Parliament and was passed in February 1935. Churchill and 83 other Conservative MPs voted against it.[267] In June 1935, MacDonald resigned and was succeeded as prime minister by Baldwin.[262] Baldwin then led the Conservatives to victory in the 1935 general election; Churchill retained his seat, but was again left out of the government.[268] In January 1936, Edward\xa0VIII succeeded his father, George\xa0V, as monarch. His desire to marry an American divorcee, Wallis Simpson, caused the abdication crisis.[269] Churchill supported Edward and clashed with Baldwin on the issue.[270] Afterwards, although Churchill immediately pledged loyalty to George\xa0VI, he wrote that the abdication was ""premature and probably quite unnecessary"".[271]', ""In May 1937, Baldwin resigned and was succeeded as prime minister by Neville Chamberlain. At first, Churchill welcomed Chamberlain's appointment but, in February 1938, matters came to a head after Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden resigned over Chamberlain's appeasement of Mussolini,[272] a policy which Chamberlain was extending towards Hitler.[273] In 1938, Churchill warned the government against appeasement and called for collective action to deter German aggression.[274][275] Following the Anschluss, Churchill spoke in the House of Commons:"", 'A country like ours, possessed of immense territory and wealth, whose defence has been neglected, cannot avoid war by dilating upon its horrors, or even by a continuous display of pacific qualities, or by ignoring the fate of the victims of aggression elsewhere. War will be avoided, in present circumstances, only by the accumulation of deterrents against the aggressor.', 'He began calling for a mutual defence pact among European states threatened by German expansionism, arguing this was the only way to halt Hitler.[277] In September, Germany mobilised to invade the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia.[278] Churchill visited Chamberlain and urged him to tell Germany that Britain would declare war if the Germans invaded Czechoslovak territory; Chamberlain was unwilling to do this.[279] On 30 September, Chamberlain signed the Munich Agreement, agreeing to allow German annexation of the Sudetenland. Speaking in the House of Commons on 5 October, Churchill called the agreement ""a total and unmitigated defeat"".[280][281][282] Following the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia in March 1939, Churchill and his supporters called for the foundation of a national coalition. His popularity increased as a result.[22]', 'On 3 September 1939, the day Britain declared war on Germany, Chamberlain reappointed Churchill as First Lord of the Admiralty and he joined Chamberlain\'s war cabinet.[283] Churchill was a highest-profile minister during the so-called ""Phoney War"". Churchill was ebullient after the Battle of the River Plate on 13 December 1939 and welcomed home the crews, congratulating them on ""a brilliant sea fight"".[284] On 16 February 1940, Churchill ordered Captain Philip Vian of the destroyer HMS\xa0Cossack to board the German supply ship Altmark in Norwegian waters freeing 299 British merchant seamen who had been captured by the Admiral Graf Spee. These actions, and his speeches, enhanced Churchill\'s reputation.[284] He was concerned about German naval activity in the Baltic and wanted to send a naval force, but this was soon changed to a plan, codenamed Operation Wilfred, to mine Norwegian waters and stop iron ore shipments from Narvik to Germany.[285] Due to disagreements, Wilfred was delayed until 8 April 1940, the day before the German invasion of Norway.[286]', ""After the Allies failed to prevent the German occupation of Norway, the Commons held a debate from 7 to 9 May on the government's conduct of the war. This became known as the Norway Debate, one of the most significant events in parliamentary history.[287] On the second day, the Labour opposition called for a division which was in effect a vote of no confidence in Chamberlain's government.[288] Churchill was called upon to wind up the debate, which placed him in the difficult position of having to defend the government without damaging his prestige.[289] Although the government won the vote, its majority was drastically reduced amid calls for a national government.[290]"", 'Early on 10 May, German forces invaded Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands as a prelude to their assault on France.[291] Since the division vote, Chamberlain had been trying to form a coalition, but Labour declared on the Friday they would not serve under his leadership, although they would accept another Conservative. The only two candidates were Churchill and Lord Halifax, the Foreign Secretary. The matter had already been discussed at a meeting on the 9th between Chamberlain, Halifax, Churchill, and David Margesson, the government Chief Whip.[291] Halifax admitted he could not govern effectively as a member of the House of Lords, so Chamberlain advised the King to send for Churchill, who became prime minister.[292] Churchill later wrote of a profound sense of relief, as he now had authority over the whole scene. He believed his life so far had been ""a preparation for this hour and for this trial"".[293][294][295]', ""In May, Churchill was still unpopular with many Conservatives and most of the Labour Party.[296] Chamberlain remained Conservative Party leader until October. By that time, Churchill had won over his doubters and his succession was a formality.[297] He began his premiership by forming a war cabinet: Chamberlain as Lord President of the Council, Labour leader Clement Attlee as Lord Privy Seal (later Deputy Prime Minister), Halifax as Foreign Secretary and Labour's Arthur Greenwood as a minister without portfolio. In practice, these five were augmented by the service chiefs and ministers who attended most meetings.[298][299] The cabinet changed in size and membership as the war progressed, a key appointment being the leading trades unionist Ernest Bevin as Minister of Labour and National Service.[300] In response to criticisms, Churchill created and assumed the position of Minister of Defence, making him the most powerful wartime prime minister in history.[301] He drafted outside experts into government to fulfil vital functions, especially on the Home Front. These included friends like Lord Beaverbrook and Frederick Lindemann, who became the government's scientific advisor.[302]"", ""At the end of May, with the British Expeditionary Force in retreat to Dunkirk and the Fall of France imminent, Halifax proposed the government should explore a peace settlement using the still-neutral Mussolini as an intermediary. There were high-level meetings from 26 to 28 May, including with the French premier Paul Reynaud.[303] Churchill's resolve was to fight on, even if France capitulated, but his position remained precarious until Chamberlain resolved to support him. Churchill had the full support of the two Labour members but knew he could not survive as prime minister if both Chamberlain and Halifax were against him. By gaining the support of his outer cabinet, Churchill outmanoeuvred Halifax and won Chamberlain over.[304]"", 'Churchill succeeded as an orator despite being handicapped from childhood with a speech impediment. He had a lateral lisp and was unable to pronounce the letter s, verbalising it with a slur.[305] He worked on his pronunciation by repeating phrases designed to cure his problem with the sibilant ""s"". He was ultimately successful, turning the impediment into an asset, as when he called Hitler a ""Nar-zee"" (rhymes with ""khazi""; emphasis on the ""z""), rather than a Nazi (""ts"").[306] His first speech as prime minister, delivered to the Commons on 13 May, was the ""blood, toil, tears and sweat"" speech.[307] Churchill made it plain to the nation that a long road lay ahead and that victory was the final goal:[308][309]', 'I would say to the House... that I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat. We have before us an ordeal of the most grievous kind. You ask, what is our policy? I will say: it is to wage war, by sea, land and air, with all our might and with all the strength that God can give us; to wage war against a monstrous tyranny, never surpassed in the dark, lamentable catalogue of human crime. That is our policy. You ask, what is our aim? I can answer in one word: it is victory, victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory, however long and hard the road may be; for without victory, there is no survival.', 'Churchill\'s use of rhetoric hardened public opinion against a peaceful resolution – Jenkins says Churchill\'s speeches were ""an inspiration for the nation, and a catharsis for Churchill himself"".[310]', 'The Dunkirk evacuation of 338,226 Allied servicemen, ended on 4 June when the French rearguard surrendered. The total was far in excess of expectations and gave rise to a popular view Dunkirk had been a miracle, even a victory.[311] Churchill himself referred to ""a miracle of deliverance"" in his ""we shall fight on the beaches"" speech to the Commons that afternoon. The speech ended on a note of defiance, with a clear appeal to the United States:[312][313]', ""We shall go on to the end. We shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air. We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills. We shall never surrender, and even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God's good time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old."", 'Germany initiated Fall Rot, in France, the following day, and Italy entered the war on the 10th.[314] The Wehrmacht occupied Paris on the 14th and completed their conquest of France on 25 June.[315] It was now inevitable that Hitler would attack and probably try to invade Great Britain. Faced with this, Churchill addressed the Commons on 18 June with one of his most famous speeches, ending with this peroration:[316][317][318]', 'What General Weygand called the ""Battle of France"" is over. I expect that the Battle of Britain is about to begin. Hitler knows that he will have to break us in this island or lose the war. Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duty and so bear ourselves that if the British Commonwealth and Empire lasts for a thousand years, men will still say: ""This was their finest hour"".', 'Churchill ordered the commencement of the Western Desert campaign on 11 June, a response to the Italian declaration of war. This went well at first while Italy was the sole opposition and Operation Compass was a success. In early 1941, however, Mussolini requested German support. Hitler sent the Afrika Korps to Tripoli under Generalleutnant Erwin Rommel, who arrived not long after Churchill had halted Compass so he could reassign forces to Greece where the Balkans campaign was entering a critical phase.[319]', 'In other initiatives through June and July 1940, Churchill ordered the formation of the Special Operations Executive (SOE) and Commandos. The SOE was ordered to promote and execute subversive activity in Nazi-occupied Europe, while the Commandos were charged with raids on military targets there. Hugh Dalton, the Minister of Economic Warfare, took political responsibility for the SOE and recorded that Churchill told him: ""And now go and set Europe ablaze"".[320]', 'On 20 August 1940, at the height of the Battle of Britain, Churchill addressed the Commons to outline the situation. In the middle of it, he made a statement that created a famous nickname for the RAF fighter pilots involved in the battle:[321][322]', 'The gratitude of every home in our Island, in our Empire, and indeed throughout the world, except in the abodes of the guilty, goes out to the British airmen who, undaunted by odds, unwearied in their constant challenge and mortal danger, are turning the tide of the World War by their prowess and by their devotion. Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.', ""The Luftwaffe altered its strategy from 7 September 1940 and began the Blitz, which was intensive through October and November. Churchill's morale was high and told his private secretary John Colville, in November, he thought the threat of invasion was past.[323] He was confident Great Britain could hold its own, given the increase in output, but was realistic about its chances of winning the war without American intervention.[324]"", ""In September 1940, the British and American governments concluded the destroyers-for-bases deal, by which 50 American destroyers were transferred to the Royal Navy in exchange for free US base rights in Bermuda, the Caribbean and Newfoundland. An added advantage for Britain was that its military assets in those bases could be redeployed elsewhere.[325] Churchill's good relations with President Franklin D. Roosevelt helped secure vital food, oil and munitions via the North Atlantic shipping routes.[326] It was for this reason that Churchill was relieved when Roosevelt was re-elected in 1940. Roosevelt set about implementing a new method of providing necessities to Great Britain, without the need for monetary payment. He persuaded Congress that repayment for this costly service would take the form of defending the US. The policy was known as Lend-Lease and was formally enacted on 11 March 1941.[327]"", 'Hitler launched his invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941. Churchill had known since April, from Enigma decrypts at Bletchley Park, that the attack was imminent. He had tried to warn Joseph Stalin via the ambassador to Moscow, Stafford Cripps, but Stalin did not trust Churchill. The night before the attack, already intending to address the nation, Churchill alluded to his hitherto anti-communist views by saying to Colville: ""If Hitler invaded Hell, I would at least make a favourable reference to the Devil"".[328]', 'In August 1941, Churchill made his first transatlantic crossing of the war on board HMS\xa0Prince of Wales and met Roosevelt in Placentia Bay, Newfoundland. On 14 August, they issued the joint statement known as the Atlantic Charter.[329] This outlined the goals of both countries for the future of the world and is seen as the inspiration for the 1942 Declaration by United Nations, itself the basis of the UN, founded in 1945.[330]', 'In December 1941, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was followed by their invasion of Malaya and, on the 8th, Churchill declared war on Japan. With the hope of using Irish ports for counter-submarine operations, Churchill sent a telegram to Irish Prime Minister Éamon de Valera in which he obliquely offers Irish unity: ""Now is your chance. Now or never! A nation once again! I will meet you wherever you wish."" No meeting took place and there is no record of a response.[331] Churchill went to Washington to meet Roosevelt for the Arcadia Conference. This was important for ""Europe first"", the decision to prioritise victory in Europe over victory in the Pacific, taken by Roosevelt while Churchill was still in the mid-Atlantic. The Americans agreed with Churchill that Hitler was the main enemy and defeat of Germany was key to Allied success.[332] It was also agreed that the first joint Anglo-American strike would be Operation Torch, the invasion of French North Africa. Originally planned for the spring 1942, it was launched in November 1942 when the crucial Second Battle of El Alamein was underway.[333]', 'On 26 December, Churchill addressed a joint meeting of the US Congress but, that night, suffered a heart attack diagnosed by his physician, Sir Charles Wilson, as a coronary deficiency needing several weeks\' bed rest. Churchill insisted he did not need bed rest and journeyed to Ottawa by train where he gave a speech to the Canadian Parliament that included the ""some chicken, some neck"" line in which he recalled French predictions in 1940 that ""Britain alone would have her neck wrung like a chicken"".[334] He arrived home mid-January, having flown from Bermuda to Plymouth in the first transatlantic air crossing by a head of government, to find there was a crisis of confidence in his government and him;[335] he decided to face a vote of confidence in the Commons, which he won easily.[336]', ""While he was away, the Eighth Army, having relieved the Siege of Tobruk, had pursued Operation Crusader against Rommel's forces in Libya, successfully driving them back to a defensive position at El Agheila in Cyrenaica. On 21 January 1942, however, Rommel launched a surprise counter-attack which drove the Allies back to Gazala. Elsewhere, British success in the Battle of the Atlantic was compromised by the Kriegsmarine's introduction of its M4 4-rotor Enigma, whose signals could not be deciphered by Bletchley Park for nearly a year.[337] At a press conference in Washington, Churchill had to play down his increasing doubts about the security of Singapore, given Japanese advances.[338]"", 'Churchill already had grave concerns about the quality of British troops after the defeats in Norway, France, Greece and Crete.[339] Following the fall of Singapore to the Japanese on 15 February 1942, he felt his misgivings were confirmed and said: ""(this is) the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British military history"".[340] On 11 February the Kriegsmarine pulled off its audacious ""Channel Dash"", a massive blow to British naval prestige. The combined effect of these events was to sink Churchill\'s morale to its lowest point of the war.[339]', 'Meanwhile, the Japanese had occupied most of Burma by the end of April 1942. Counter-offensives were hampered by the monsoon season and disordered conditions in Bengal and Bihar, as well as a severe cyclone which devastated the region in October 1942. A combination of factors, including the curtailment of essential rice imports from Burma, poor administration, wartime inflation and large-scale natural disasters such as flooding and crop disease led to the Bengal famine of 1943,[341] in which an estimated 2.1–3.8 million people died.[342]', ""From December 1942, food shortages had prompted senior officials to ask London for grain imports, although the colonial authorities failed to recognise the seriousness of the famine and responded ineptly.[343] Churchill's government was criticised for refusing to approve more imports, a policy it ascribed to an acute shortage of shipping.[344] When the British realised the full extent of the famine in September 1943, Churchill ordered the transportation of 130,000 tons of grain and the cabinet agreed to send 200,000 tons by the end of the year.[345][346] During the last quarter of 1943, 100,000 tons of rice and 176,000 tons of wheat were imported, compared to averages of 55,000 and 54,000 tons respectively earlier in the year.[347]"", 'In October, Churchill wrote to the Viceroy of India, Lord Wavell, charging him with the responsibility of ending the famine.[345] In February 1944, as preparation for Operation Overlord placed greater demands on Allied shipping, Churchill cabled Wavell saying: ""I will certainly help you all I can, but you must not ask the impossible"".[346] Grain shipment requests continued to be turned down by the government throughout 1944, and Wavell complained to Churchill in October that ""the vital problems of India are being treated by His Majesty\'s Government with neglect, even sometimes with hostility and contempt"".[344][348] The impact of British policies on the famine death toll remains controversial.[349]', 'On 20 May 1942, the Soviet Foreign minister, Vyacheslav Molotov, arrived in London to sign a treaty of friendship. Molotov wanted it done on the basis of territorial concessions regarding Poland and the Baltic countries. Churchill and Eden worked for a compromise and a twenty-year treaty was formalised, with the question of frontiers placed on hold. Molotov also sought a Second Front in Europe; Churchill confirmed preparations were in progress and made no promises on a date.[350]', 'Churchill felt pleased with these negotiations.[351] However, Rommel had launched his counter-offensive, Operation Venice, to begin the Battle of Gazala on 26 May.[351] The Allies were driven out of Libya and suffered a defeat in the fall of Tobruk on 21 June. Churchill was with Roosevelt when the news reached him, and was shocked by the surrender of 35,000 troops which was, apart from Singapore, ""the heaviest blow"" he received in the war.[352] The Axis advance was halted at the First Battle of El Alamein in July and the Battle of Alam el Halfa in September. Both sides were exhausted and in need of reinforcements and supplies.[353]', 'Churchill returned to Washington on 17 June. He and Roosevelt agreed on the implementation of Operation Torch as the necessary precursor to an invasion of Europe. Roosevelt had appointed General Dwight D. Eisenhower as commanding officer of the European Theater of Operations, United States Army (ETOUSA). Having received the news from North Africa, Churchill obtained shipment from America to the Eighth Army of 300 Sherman tanks and 100 howitzers. He returned to Britain on 25 June and had to face another motion of no confidence, this time in his direction of the war, but again he won easily.[354]', ""In August, despite health concerns, Churchill visited British forces in North Africa, raising morale, en route to Moscow for his first meeting with Stalin. He was accompanied by Roosevelt's special envoy Averell Harriman.[355] He was in Moscow 12–16 August and had lengthy meetings with Stalin. Though they got along well personally, there was little chance of real progress given the state of the war. Stalin was desperate for the Allies to open the Second Front in Europe, as Churchill had discussed with Molotov in May, and the answer was the same.[356]"", ""While he was in Cairo in August, Churchill appointed Field Marshal Alexander as Field Marshal Auchinleck's successor as Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East Theatre. Command of the Eighth Army was given to General William Gott but he was shot down and killed while flying to Cairo, and General Montgomery succeeded him.[357]"", 'As 1942 drew to a close, the tide of war began to turn with Allied victories in El Alamein and Stalingrad. Until November, the Allies had been on the defensive, but afterwards, the Germans were. Churchill ordered church bells to be rung throughout Great Britain for the first time since 1940.[357] On 10 November, knowing El Alamein was a victory, he delivered one of his most memorable speeches at Mansion House in London: ""This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning"".[357]', 'In January 1943, Churchill met Roosevelt at the Casablanca Conference. It was attended by General Charles de Gaulle from the Free French Forces. Stalin had hoped to attend but declined because of Stalingrad. Although Churchill expressed doubts on the matter, the so-called Casablanca Declaration committed the Allies to securing ""unconditional surrender"".[358][359] From Morocco, Churchill went to Cairo, Adana, Cyprus, Cairo again and Algiers. He arrived home on 7 February having been out of the country for a month. He addressed the Commons on the 11th and became seriously ill with pneumonia the following day, necessitating more than a month of convalescence: he moved to Chequers. He returned to work in London on 15 March.[360]', 'Churchill made two transatlantic crossings during the year, meeting Roosevelt at the third Washington Conference in May and the first Quebec Conference in August.[361] In November, Churchill and Roosevelt met Chinese Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek at the Cairo Conference.[362] The most important conference of the year was 28 November to 1 December at Tehran, where Churchill and Roosevelt met Stalin in the first of the ""Big Three"" meetings, preceding those at Yalta and Potsdam. Roosevelt and Stalin co-operated in persuading Churchill to commit to opening of second front in western Europe and it was agreed Germany would be divided after the war, but no decisions were made about how.[363] On their way back, Churchill and Roosevelt held a Second Cairo Conference with Turkish president İsmet İnönü, but were unable to gain commitment from Turkey to join the Allies.[364]', ""Churchill went to Tunis, arriving on 10 December, initially as Eisenhower's guest (soon afterwards, Eisenhower took over as Supreme Allied Commander of the new SHAEF). Churchill became seriously ill with atrial fibrillation and was forced to remain in Tunis, until after Christmas while specialists were drafted in to ensure recovery. Clementine and Colville arrived to keep him company; Colville had just returned to Downing Street after two years in the RAF. On 27 December, the party went on to Marrakesh for convalescence. Feeling much better, Churchill flew to Gibraltar on 14 January 1944 and sailed home on the King George V. He was back in London on 18 January and surprised MPs by attending Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons. Since 12 January 1943, when he set off for Casablanca, Churchill had been abroad or seriously ill for 203 of the 371 days.[365]"", 'In the autumn of 1942, after Churchill\'s meeting with Stalin, he was approached by Eisenhower, commanding the North African Theater of Operations, US Army (NATOUSA), and his aides on the subject of where the Western Allies should launch their first strike in Europe. According to General Mark W. Clark, the Americans admitted a cross-Channel operation in the near future was ""utterly impossible"". As an alternative, Churchill recommended ""slit(ting) the soft belly of the Mediterranean"" and persuaded them to invade Sicily and then mainland Italy, after they had defeated the Afrika Korps.  After the war, Clark still agreed Churchill\'s analysis was correct, but added that, when the Allies landed at Salerno, they found Italy was ""a tough old gut"".[366]', 'The invasion of Sicily began on 9 July and was completed by 17 August. Churchill was not keen on Overlord as he feared an Anglo-American army in France might not be a match for the fighting efficiency of the Wehrmacht. He preferred peripheral operations, including a plan called Operation Jupiter for an invasion of Norway.[367] Events in Sicily had an unexpected impact in Italy. King Victor Emmanuel sacked Mussolini on 25 July and appointed Marshal Badoglio as prime minister. Badoglio opened negotiations with the Allies which resulted in the Armistice of Cassibile on 3 September. In response, the Germans activated Operation Achse and took control of most of Italy.[368]', 'Although he still preferred Italy to Normandy as the Allies\' main route into the Third Reich, Churchill was concerned about the strong German resistance at Salerno and, after the Allies successfully gained their bridgehead at Anzio but still failed to break the stalemate, he caustically said that instead of ""hurling a wildcat onto the shore"", the Allied force had become a ""stranded whale"".[369][370] The big obstacle was Monte Cassino and it was not until May 1944 when it was finally overcome, enabling the Allies to advance on Rome, which was taken on 4 June.[371]', 'The difficulties in Italy caused Churchill to change heart about strategy; when the Anzio stalemate developed after his return to England from North Africa, he threw himself into the planning of Overlord and set up meetings with SHAEF and the British Chiefs of Staff. These were attended by Eisenhower or his chief of staff General Walter Bedell Smith. Churchill was especially taken by the Mulberry harbours, but was keen to make the most of Allied airpower which by 1944, had become overwhelming.[371] Churchill never lost his apprehension about the invasion, and underwent mood fluctuation as D-Day approached. Jenkins says he faced potential victory with much less buoyancy than when he defiantly faced the prospect of defeat four years earlier.[372]', 'Churchill could not ignore the need for post-war reforms. The Beveridge Report with its five ""Giant Evils"" was published in November 1942 and assumed great importance amid popular acclaim.[373] Even so, Churchill spent most of his focus on the war, and saw reform in terms of tidying up. His attitude was demonstrated in a radio broadcast on 26 March 1944. He was obliged to devote most of it to reform and showed a distinct lack of interest. Colville said Churchill had broadcast ""indifferently"" and Harold Nicolson said that, to many people, Churchill came across the air as ""a worn and petulant old man"".[374] In the end, however, it was demand for reform that decided the 1945 general election. Labour was perceived as the party that would deliver Beveridge. Attlee, Bevin and Labour\'s other coalition ministers, were seen as working towards reform and earned the trust of the electorate.[375][376]', 'Churchill was determined to be actively involved in the Normandy invasion and hoped to cross the Channel on D-Day (6 June 1944) or at least D-Day+1. His desire caused unnecessary consternation at SHAEF, until he was effectively vetoed by the King. Churchill expected an Allied death toll of 20,000 on D-Day but fewer than 8,000 died in all of June.[377] He made his first visit to Normandy on 12 June to visit Montgomery, whose HQ was five miles inland. That evening, as he was returning to London, the first V-1 flying bombs were launched. On 22–23 July, Churchill went to Cherbourg and Arromanches where he saw the Mulberry Harbour.[378]', 'Churchill met Roosevelt at the Second Quebec Conference in September 1944. They reached agreement on the Morgenthau Plan for the Allied occupation of Germany, the intention of which was not only to demilitarise, but de-industrialise. Eden opposed it and was able to persuade Churchill to disown it. US Secretary of State Cordell Hull opposed it and convinced Roosevelt it was infeasible.[379]', 'At the fourth Moscow conference in October 1944, Churchill and Eden met Stalin and Molotov. This conference has gained notoriety for the so-called ""Percentages agreement"" in which Churchill and Stalin effectively agreed the post-war fate of the Balkans.[380] By then, the Soviet armies were in Rumania and Bulgaria. Churchill suggested a scale of predominance throughout the whole region so as not to, as he put it, ""get at cross-purposes in small ways"".[381] He wrote down some suggested percentages of influence per country and gave it to Stalin who ticked it. The agreement was that Russia would have 90% control of Romania and 75% control of Bulgaria. The United Kingdom and United States would have 90% control of Greece. Hungary and Yugoslavia would be 50% each.[382] In 1958, five years after the account of this meeting was published (in The Second World War), Soviet authorities denied Stalin had accepted such an ""imperialist proposal"".[380]', 'From 30 January to 2 February 1945, Churchill and Roosevelt met for their Malta Conference ahead of the second ""Big Three"" event at Yalta from 4 to 11 February.[383] Yalta had massive implications for the post-war world. There were two predominant issues: the question of setting up the United Nations Organisation, on which much progress was made; and the more vexed question of Poland\'s post-war status, which Churchill saw as a test case for Eastern Europe.[384] Churchill faced criticism for the agreement on Poland. For example, 27 Tory MPs voted against him when the matter was debated in the Commons at the end of the month. Jenkins, however, maintains that Churchill did as well as possible in difficult circumstances, not least the fact that Roosevelt was seriously ill and could not provide Churchill with meaningful support.[385]', 'Another outcome of Yalta was the so-called Operation Keelhaul. The Western Allies agreed to the forcible repatriation of all Soviet citizens in the Allied zones, including prisoners of war, to the Soviet Union and the policy was later extended to all Eastern European refugees, many of whom were anti-Communist. Keelhaul was implemented between August 1946 and May 1947.[386][387]', 'On the nights of 13–15 February 1945, 1,200 British and US bombers attacked Dresden, which was crowded with wounded and refugees from the Eastern Front.[388][389] The attacks were part of an area bombing campaign initiated by Churchill in January with the intention of shortening the war.[390] Churchill came to regret the bombing because initial reports suggested an excessive number of civilian casualties close to the end of the war, though an independent commission in 2010 confirmed a death toll of about 24,000.[391] On 28 March, he decided to restrict area bombing[392] and sent a memo to General Ismay for the Chiefs of Staff Committee:[393][394]', 'The destruction of Dresden remains a serious query against the conduct of Allied bombing.... I feel the need for more precise concentration upon military objectives.... rather than on mere acts of terror and wanton destruction, however impressive.', 'Historian Frederick Taylor has pointed out that the number of Soviets who died from German bombing was roughly equivalent to the number of Germans who died from Allied raids.[395] Jenkins asks if Churchill was moved more by foreboding than by regret but admits it is easy to criticise with the hindsight of victory. He adds that the area bombing campaign was no more reprehensible than President Truman\'s use of the second atomic bomb on Nagasaki six months later.[392] Andrew Marr, quoting Max Hastings, says that Churchill\'s memo was a ""calculated political attempt...to distance himself...from the rising controversy surrounding the area offensive"".[394]', 'On 7 May 1945 at the SHAEF headquarters in Reims the Allies accepted Germany\'s surrender. The next day was Victory in Europe Day (VE Day) when Churchill broadcast to the nation that Germany had surrendered and that a final ceasefire would come into effect at one minute past midnight that night.[396] Churchill went to Buckingham Palace where he appeared on the balcony with the Royal Family before a huge crowd of celebrating citizens. He went from the palace to Whitehall where he addressed another large crowd: ""God bless you all. This is your victory. In our long history, we have never seen a greater day than this. Everyone, man or woman, has done their best"".[397]', 'He asked Bevin to come forward and share the applause. Bevin said: ""No, Winston, this is your day"", and proceeded to conduct the people in the singing of ""For He\'s a Jolly Good Fellow"".[397] In the evening, Churchill made another broadcast correctly asserting that the defeat of Japan would follow in the coming months.[398]', 'Later in the month France attempted to put down a nationalist uprising in the Syria. Churchill intervened and on 31 May gave de Gaulle an ultimatum to desist, but this was ignored. In what became known as the Levant Crisis, British forces from Transjordan were mobilised to restore order. The French, outnumbered, had no option but to return to their bases. De Gaulle felt humiliated, and a diplomatic row broke out - Churchill reportedly told a colleague that de Gaulle was ""a great danger to peace and for Great Britain"".[399]', 'In May 1945, Winston Churchill commissioned the Chiefs of Staff Committee to provide its thoughts on a possible military campaign against the USSR, code-named Operation Unthinkable.[400] One plan involved a surprise attack on Soviet troops stationed in Germany to impose ""the will of the United States and the British Empire"" on the Soviets.[401] The hypothetical start date for the Allied invasion of Soviet-held Europe was set for 1 July 1945.[401]', ""With a general election looming, and with Labour ministers refusing to continue the coalition, Churchill resigned as prime minister on 23 May 1945. Later that day, he accepted the King's invitation to form a new government, known officially as the National Government but sometimes called the caretaker ministry. It contained Conservatives, National Liberals and a few non-party figures such as Sir John Anderson and Lord Woolton, but not Labour or Archibald Sinclair's Official Liberals. Churchill was formally reappointed on 28 May.[402][403]"", 'Churchill was Great Britain\'s representative at the Potsdam Conference when it opened on 17 July and was accompanied at its sessions by Eden and Attlee. They attended nine sessions in nine days before returning to England for their election counts. After the landslide Labour victory, Attlee returned with Bevin as the new Foreign Secretary and there were five days of discussion.[404] Potsdam went badly for Churchill. Eden later described his performance as ""appalling"", saying he was unprepared and verbose. Churchill upset the Chinese, exasperated the Americans and was easily led by Stalin, whom he was supposed to be resisting.[405]', 'Churchill mishandled the election campaign by resorting to party politics and trying to denigrate Labour.[406] On 4 June, he committed a serious gaffe by saying in a radio broadcast that a Labour government would require ""some form of Gestapo"" to enforce its agenda.[407][408] It backfired and Attlee made political capital by saying in his reply broadcast next day: ""The voice we heard last night was that of Mr Churchill, but the mind was that of Lord Beaverbrook"". Jenkins says that this broadcast was ""the making of Attlee"".[409]', 'Although polling day was 5 July, the results did not become known until 26 July, owing to the need to collect votes of those serving overseas. Clementine and daughter Mary had been at the count in Woodford, Churchill\'s new constituency, and had returned to Downing Street to meet him for lunch. Churchill was unopposed by the major parties in Woodford, but his majority over a sole independent candidate was much less than expected. He anticipated defeat by Labour and Mary later described the lunch as ""an occasion of Stygian gloom"".[410][411] To Clementine\'s suggestion that defeat might be ""a blessing in disguise"", Churchill retorted: ""At the moment it seems very effectively disguised"".[410]', 'That afternoon Churchill\'s doctor Lord Moran commiserated with him on the ""ingratitude"" of the public, to which Churchill replied: ""I wouldn\'t call it that. They have had a very hard time"".[411] Having lost, despite enjoying personal support amongst the population, he resigned as prime minister and was succeeded by Attlee who formed the first majority Labour government.[412][413][414][415] Many reasons have been given for Churchill\'s defeat, key being a widespread desire for reform and that the man who had led Britain in war was not seen as the man to lead in peace.[416][417] Although the Conservative Party was unpopular, many electors appear to have wanted Churchill to continue as prime minister whatever the outcome, or to have wrongly believed this would be possible.[418]', 'Churchill continued to lead the Conservative Party and served as Leader of the Opposition. In 1946, he was in America from early January to late March.[419] It was on this trip he gave his ""Iron Curtain"" speech about the USSR and its creation of the Eastern Bloc.[420] Speaking on 5 March 1946 in the company of President Truman at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri, Churchill declared:[421]', 'From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an Iron Curtain has descended across the continent. Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe. Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, Bucharest and Sofia, all these famous cities and the populations around them lie in what I must call the Soviet sphere.', 'His view was that, though the Soviet Union did not want war with the western Allies, its entrenched position in Eastern Europe had made it impossible for the three great powers to provide the world with a ""triangular leadership"". Churchill\'s desire was much closer collaboration between Britain and America. Within the same speech, he called for ""a special relationship between the British Commonwealth and Empire and the United States"",[421] but emphasised the need for co-operation within the framework of the United Nations Charter.[422]', 'Churchill was an early proponent of pan-Europeanism, having called for a ""United States of Europe"" in a 1930 article. He supported the creations of the Council of Europe in 1949 and the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951, but his support was always with the firm proviso that Britain must not actually join any federal grouping.[423][424][425]', 'Having lived in Ireland as a child, Churchill always opposed its partition. As a minister in 1913 and again in 1921, he suggested that Ulster should be part of a united Ireland, but with a degree of autonomy from an independent Irish government. He was always opposed on this by Ulster Unionists.[426] While he was Leader of the Opposition, he told John Dulanty and Frederick Boland, successive Irish ambassadors to London, that he still hoped for reunification.[427]', 'Labour won the 1950 general election, but with a much-reduced majority.[428] A fresh election was called the following year and the Conservatives won a majority.', ""Despite losing the popular vote, the Conservatives won a majority of 17 seats in the October 1951 general election and Churchill became prime minister, remaining in office until his resignation on 5 April 1955.[429] Eden, his eventual successor, was restored to Foreign Affairs.[430] Future prime minister Harold Macmillan was appointed Minister of Housing and Local Government with a manifesto commitment to build 300,000 new houses per year, Churchill's only real domestic concern. He achieved the target and, in 1954, was promoted to Minister of Defence.[431]"", ""Churchill was nearly 77 when he took office and not in good health following minor strokes.[432] By December 1951, George\xa0VI had become concerned about Churchill's decline and intended asking him to stand down in favour of Eden, but the King had his own health issues and died on 6 February 1952.[433] Churchill developed a friendship with Elizabeth\xa0II and, in spring 1953, accepted the Order of the Garter at her request.[434] He was knighted as Sir Winston on 24 April 1953.[435] It was widely expected he would retire after the Queen's Coronation in June 1953 but, after Eden became seriously ill, Churchill increased his own responsibilities by taking over at the Foreign Office.[436][437][438] Eden was incapacitated until the end of the year and never completely well again.[439] On the evening of 23 June 1953, Churchill suffered a serious stroke; the matter was kept secret and Churchill went to Chartwell to recuperate. He had recovered by November.[440][441][442] He retired in April 1955 and was succeeded by Eden.[443]"", ""Churchill feared a global conflagration and firmly believed the only way to preserve peace and freedom was friendship and co-operation between Britain and America. He made four official transatlantic visits from January 1952 to July 1954.[444] He enjoyed a good relationship with Truman, but difficulties arose over the planned European Defence Community (EDC), by which Truman hoped to reduce America's military presence in West Germany.[445] Churchill wanted US military support of British interests in Egypt and the Middle East, but while Truman expected British military involvement in Korea, he viewed any US commitment to the Middle East as maintaining British imperialism.[446] The Americans recognised the British Empire was in terminal decline and had welcomed the Attlee government's policy of decolonisation. Churchill believed Britain's position as a world power depended on the empire's continued existence.[447]"", ""Churchill had been obliged to recognise Colonel Nasser's revolutionary government of Egypt, which took power in 1952. Much to Churchill's dismay, agreement was reached in October 1954 on the phased evacuation of British troops from their Suez base. Britain agreed to terminate its rule in Anglo-Egyptian Sudan by 1956, though this was in return for Nasser's abandonment of Egyptian claims over the region.[448] Elsewhere, the Malayan Emergency, a guerrilla war fought by Communist fighters against Commonwealth forces, had begun in 1948 and continued until 1960. Churchill's government maintained the military response to the crisis and adopted a similar strategy for the Mau Mau Uprising in British Kenya (1952–1960).[449]"", ""Churchill was uneasy about the election of Eisenhower as Truman's successor. After Stalin died in March 1953, Churchill sought a summit meeting with the Soviets, but Eisenhower refused out of fear the Soviets would use it for propaganda.[450][436][451] By July, Churchill was deeply regretting that the Democrats had not been returned. Churchill believed Eisenhower did not fully comprehend the danger posed by the H-bomb and he greatly distrusted Eisenhower's Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles.[452] Churchill hosted Eisenhower at the Three-Powers Bermuda Conference, with French Prime Minister Joseph Laniel, in December;[453][454] they met again in June/July 1954 at the White House.[455] In the end, the Soviets proposed a four-power summit, but it did not meet until July 1955, three months after Churchill's retirement.[456][457]"", ""Elizabeth\xa0II offered to create Churchill Duke of London, but he declined because of the objections of Randolph, who would have inherited the title.[458] Although publicly supportive, Churchill was privately scathing about Eden's handling of the Suez Crisis and Clementine believed that many of his visits to the US in the following years were attempts to repair Anglo-American relations.[459]"", 'Churchill remained an MP until he stood down at the 1964 general election.[460] By the time of the 1959 general election, he seldom attended the House of Commons. Despite the Conservative landslide in 1959, his own majority fell by more than 1,000. He spent most of his retirement at Chartwell or at his London home in Hyde Park Gate, and became a habitué of high society at La Pausa on the French Riviera.[461]In June 1962, aged 87, Churchill had a fall in Monte Carlo and broke his hip. He was flown home to a London hospital where he remained for 3 weeks. Jenkins says Churchill was never the same after this.[460] In 1963, US President John F. Kennedy, acting under authorisation granted by an Act of Congress, proclaimed him an honorary citizen of the United States, but he was unable to attend the White House ceremony.[460] There has been speculation he became very depressed in his final years, but this has been emphatically denied by his secretary Anthony Montague Browne, who was with him for his last 10 years. Montague Browne wrote that he never heard Churchill refer to depression and certainly did not suffer from it.[462]', ""Churchill suffered his final stroke on 10 January 1965 and died on 24 January.[460][463] Like the Duke of Wellington in 1852 and William Gladstone in 1898, Churchill was given a state funeral.[460] His coffin lay in state at Westminster Hall for three days. The funeral ceremony was at St Paul's Cathedral on 30 January.[460][463] Afterwards, the coffin was taken by boat along the River Thames to Waterloo Station and from there by a special train to the family plot at St Martin's Church, Bladon.[464][463]"", 'Worldwide, numerous memorials have been dedicated to Churchill. His statue in Parliament Square was unveiled by his widow Clementine in 1973 and is one of only twelve in the square.[465][466] Elsewhere in London, the Cabinet War Rooms have been renamed the Churchill War Rooms.[467] Churchill College, Cambridge, was established as a national memorial to Churchill. In a 2002 BBC poll which attracted 447,423 votes, he was voted the greatest-ever Briton, his nearest rival being Isambard Kingdom Brunel some 56,000 votes behind.[468]', 'Churchill was the first of only eight people to be granted honorary citizenship of the United States.[469] The United States Navy honoured him in 1999 by naming a Arleigh Burke-class destroyer as the USS\xa0Winston S. Churchill.[470] Other memorials in North America include the National Churchill Museum in Fulton, where he made the 1946 ""Iron Curtain"" speech; Churchill Square in Edmonton, Alberta; and the Winston Churchill Range, a mountain range northwest of Lake Louise, also in Alberta, which was renamed after Churchill in 1956.[471]', 'Churchill was a prolific writer. His output included a novel (Savrola), two biographies, memoirs, histories, and press articles. Two of his most famous works were his six-volume memoir, The Second World War, and the four-volume A History of the English-Speaking Peoples.[472] In recognition of his ""mastery of historical and biographical description"" and oratorial output, Churchill received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1953.[473]', 'He used either ""Winston S. Churchill"" or ""Winston Spencer Churchill"" as his pen name to avoid confusion with the American novelist Winston Churchill, whom he had a friendly correspondence with.[474] For many years, he relied on his press articles to assuage his financial worries.[475]', 'Churchill became an accomplished amateur artist beginning after his resignation from the Admiralty in 1915.[476] Often using the pseudonym ""Charles Morin"",[477] he completed hundreds of paintings, many of which are on show in Chartwell and in private collections.[478]', 'Churchill was an amateur bricklayer, constructing buildings and garden walls at Chartwell.[477] He joined the Amalgamated Union of Building Trade Workers, but was expelled after he rejoined the Conservative Party.[477] He bred butterflies.[479] He was known for his love of animals and always had several pets, mainly cats but also dogs, pigs, lambs, bantams, goats and fox cubs among others.[480] Churchill has been quoted as saying that ""Dogs look up to you, cats look down on you. Give me a pig! He looks you in the eye and treats you as an equal"".[481]', 'Jenkins concludes his biography of Churchill by comparing him favourably with William Gladstone and summarising:[464]', 'I now put Churchill, with all his idiosyncrasies, his indulgences, his occasional childishness, but also his genius, his tenacity and his persistent ability, right or wrong, successful or unsuccessful, to be larger than life, as the greatest human being ever to occupy 10 Downing Street.', 'Churchill always self-confidently believed himself to be ""a man of destiny"".[482] Because of this he lacked restraint and could be reckless.[483][484] His self-belief manifested in his ""affinity with war"" of which, according to Sebastian Haffner, he exhibited ""a profound and innate understanding"".[485] Churchill considered himself a military genius, but that made him vulnerable to failure and Paul Addison says the Gallipoli disaster was ""the greatest blow his self-image was ever to sustain"".[486] Jenkins points out, that although Churchill was exhilarated by war, he was never indifferent to the suffering it causes.[487]', 'As a politician, Churchill was perceived by some to have been largely motivated by personal ambition rather than political principle.[488][489] During his early career, he was often provocative and argumentative to an unusual degree;[490] and his barbed rhetorical style earned him enemies in parliament.[491][492] On the other hand, he was deemed to be an honest politician who displayed particular loyalty to his family and close friends.[493] Robert Rhodes James said he ""lacked any capacity for intrigue and was refreshingly innocent and straightforward"".[494]', 'Until the outbreak of the Second World War, Churchill\'s approach to politics generated widespread ""mistrust and dislike"",[495] largely on account of his two party defections.[496] His biographers have variously categorised him, in terms of political ideology, as ""fundamentally conservative"",[497] ""(always) liberal in outlook"",[498] and ""never circumscribed by party affiliation"".[499] He was nearly always opposed to socialism because of its propensity for state planning and his belief in free markets. The exception was during his wartime coalition when he was reliant upon the support of his Labour colleagues.[500][501] Churchill had long been regarded as an enemy of the working class, and his response to the Rhondda Valley unrest and his anti-socialist rhetoric brought condemnation from socialists who saw him as a reactionary.[502] His role in opposing the General Strike earned the enmity of strikers and most members of the Labour movement.[503] Paradoxically, Churchill was supportive of trade unionism, which he saw as the ""antithesis of socialism"".[504]', 'On the other hand, his detractors did not take Churchill\'s domestic reforms into account,[505] for he was in many respects a radical and reformer,[506] but always with the intention of preserving the existing social structure,[507] displaying what Addison calls the attitude of a ""benevolent paternalist"".[508] Jenkins, himself a senior Labour minister, remarked that Churchill had ""a substantial record as a social reformer"" for his work in his ministerial career.[509] Similarly, Rhodes James thought that Churchill\'s achievements were ""considerable"".[510]', 'Churchill was a staunch imperialist and monarchist, and consistently exhibited a ""romanticised view"" of the British Empire and reigning monarch, especially during his last term as premier.[511][512][513] Churchill has been described as a ""liberal imperialist""[514] who saw British imperialism as a form of altruism that benefited its subject peoples.[515] He advocated against black or indigenous self-rule in Africa, Australia, the Caribbean, the Americas and India, believing the British Empire maintained the welfare of those who lived in the colonies.[345]', 'According to Addison, Churchill was opposed to immigration from the Commonwealth.[516] Addison makes the point that Churchill opposed anti-Semitism (as in 1904, when he was critical of the proposed Aliens Bill) and argues he would never have tried ""to stoke up racial animosity against immigrants, or to persecute minorities"".[517]  In the 1920s, Churchill supported Zionism but believed that communism was the product of an international Jewish conspiracy.[518] Although this belief was not unique among politicians, few had his stature,[519] and the article he wrote on the subject was criticised by The Jewish Chronicle.[520]', 'Churchill made disparaging remarks about non-white ethnicities throughout his life. Philip Murphy partly attributes the strength of this vitriol to an ""almost childish desire to shock"" his inner circle.[521] Churchill\'s response to the Bengal famine was criticised by contemporaries as slow, a controversy later increased by the publication of private remarks made to Secretary for India Leo Amery, in which Churchill allegedly said aid would be inadequate because ""Indians [were] breeding like rabbits"".[521][522] Philip Murphy says that, following the independence of India in 1947, Churchill adopted a pragmatic stance towards empire, although he continued to use imperial rhetoric. During his second term as prime minister, he was seen as a moderating influence on Britain\'s suppression of armed insurgencies in Malaya and Kenya; he argued that ruthless policies contradicted British values and international opinion.[521]', ""While biographies by Addison, Gilbert, Jenkins and Rhodes James are among the most acclaimed works about Churchill, he has been the subject of numerous others. David Freeman counted 62 in English to the end of the 20th century.[523] At a public ceremony in Westminster Hall on 30 November 1954, Churchill's 80th birthday, the joint Houses of Parliament presented him with a full-length portrait of himself, painted by Graham Sutherland.[524] Churchill and Clementine reportedly hated it and she had it destroyed.[525][526]"", 'Biographical films include Young Winston (1972), directed by Richard Attenborough and featuring Simon Ward in the title role; Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years (1981), starring Robert Hardy; The Gathering Storm (2002), starring Albert Finney as Churchill; Into the Storm (2009), starring Brendan Gleeson as Churchill; Darkest Hour (2017), starring Gary Oldman as Churchill. John Lithgow played Churchill in The Crown (2016–2019). Finney, Gleeson, Oldman and Lithgow all won awards for their performances.[527][528][529][530]', 'Churchill married Clementine Hozier in September 1908.[531] They remained married for 57 years until his death.[107] Churchill was aware of the strain his career placed on their marriage.[532] According to Colville, he had an affair in the 1930s with Doris Castlerosse,[533] although this is discounted by Andrew Roberts.[534]', ""The Churchills' first child, Diana, was born in July 1909;[535] Randolph, in May 1911.[145] Sarah, was born in October 1914,[168] and Marigold, in November 1918.[197] Marigold died in August 1921, from sepsis.[536] On 15 September 1922, the Churchills' last child, Mary, was born. Later that month, the Churchills bought Chartwell, which would be their home until Winston's death in 1965.[537][538]"", 'Other references and online collections', 'Museums, archives and libraries']","Sir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill[a] (30 November 1874 – 24 January 1965) was a British statesman, military officer, and writer who was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1940 to 1945 (during the Second World War) and again from 1951 to 1955. Apart from 1922 to 1924, he was a member of Parliament (MP) from 1900 to 1964 and represented a total of five constituencies. Ideologically an adherent to economic liberalism and imperialism, he was for most of his career a member of the Conservative Party, which he led from 1940 to 1955. He was a member of the Liberal Party from 1904 to 1924.","Here are some additional points about Winston Churchill:

Chiang_Kai-shek,"['Chiang Kai-shek[a] (31 October 1887\xa0– 5 April 1975) was a Chinese politician, revolutionary, and military commander who was the leader of the Nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) party and commander-in-chief and Generalissimo of the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) from 1926, and leader of the Republic of China (ROC) in mainland China from 1928. After Chiang was defeated in the Chinese Civil War by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 1949, he continued to lead the Republic of China on the island of Taiwan until his death in 1975. He was considered the legitimate head of China by the United Nations until 1971.', ""Born in Zhejiang, Chiang received a military education in China and Japan and joined Sun Yat-sen's Tongmenghui revolutionary organization in 1908. After the 1911 Revolution, he was a founding member of the KMT, becoming one of Sun's closest lieutenants and head of the Whampoa Military Academy. After Sun's death in 1925, Chiang became commander-in-chief of the NRA, and led the Northern Expedition from 1926 to 1928, which nominally reunified China under a Nationalist government in Nanjing. During the campaign, the KMT–CCP alliance broke down in 1927 and Chiang massacred the communists in Shanghai, triggering the Chinese Civil War. As the leader of the ROC during the Nanjing decade, Chiang sought to modernise and unify the nation, although hostilities with the CCP continued. His government presided over economic and social reconstruction while trying to avoid a war with Japan. In 1936, he was kidnapped in the Xi'an Incident, and obliged to form an anti-Japanese Second United Front with the CCP."", ""After the Marco Polo Bridge incident in 1937, Chiang mobilised China for the Second Sino-Japanese War, and over the next eight years led the war of resistance, mostly from Chongqing. As the leader of a major Allied power, Chiang attended the Cairo Conference to discuss terms for the Japanese surrender. When the Second World War ended, the civil war with the Communists (led by Mao Zedong) resumed; in 1949,  Chiang's government was defeated and retreated to the island of Taiwan, where he imposed martial law and persecuted critics in the White Terror, which lasted until his death. Presiding over economic reforms and rapid growth, starting in 1948 Chiang won five elections to six-year terms as President of the ROC in which he faced minimal opposition or was elected unopposed[clarification needed]. He was also Director-General of the KMT until his death in 1975, and was succeeded by his son Chiang Ching-kuo, who became president in 1978. "", 'Like Mao, Chiang is a controversial figure. Supporters credit him with unifying the nation and ending the century of humiliation, leading the resistance against Japan, and economic development in mainland China and Taiwan. Critics portray him as a brutal right-wing dictator and head of a corrupt authoritarian regime which massacred civilians and suppressed political dissent. He is also criticized for his flooding of the Yellow River and for mishandling the Henan famine[not verified in body] response during the war with Japan. Chiang is also credited with transforming China from a semi-colony of various imperialist powers to an independent country by amending the unequal treaties signed by previous governments, as well as moving various national treasures and traditional artworks to the National Palace Museum in Taipei during the 1949 retreat.', 'Like many other Chinese historical figures, Chiang used several names throughout his life. The name inscribed in the genealogical records of his family is Chiang Chou-t‘ai (Chinese: 蔣周泰; pinyin: Jiǎng Zhōutài; Wade–Giles: Chiang3 Chou1-t‘ai4). This so-called ""register name"" (譜名) is the one by which his extended relatives knew him, and the one he used in formal occasions, such as when he was married. In deference to tradition, family members did not use the register name in conversation with people outside of the family. The concept of a ""real"" or original name is/was not as clear-cut in China as it is in the Western world. In honor of tradition, Chinese families waited a number of years before officially naming their children. In the meantime, they used a ""milk name"" (乳名), given to the infant shortly after his birth and known only to the close family. So the name that Chiang received at birth was Chiang Jui-yüan[3] (Chinese: 蔣瑞元; pinyin: Jiǎng Ruìyuán).', 'In 1903, the 16-year-old Chiang went to Ningbo as a student, and chose a ""school name"" (學名). This was the formal name of a person, used by older people to address him, and the one he would use the most in the first decades of his life (as a person grew older, younger generations would use one of the courtesy names instead). Colloquially, the school name is called ""big name"" (大名), whereas the ""milk name"" is known as the ""small name"" (小名). The school name that Chiang chose for himself was Chih-ch‘ing (Chinese: 志清; pinyin: Zhīqīng; Wade–Giles: Chih-ch‘ing, which means ""purity of aspirations""). For the next fifteen years or so, Chiang was known as Chiang Chih-ch‘ing Chinese: 蔣志清; pinyin: Jiang Zhīqīng; Wade–Giles: Chiang3 Chih1-ch‘ing1. This is the name by which Sun Yat-sen knew him when Chiang joined the republicans in Kwangtung in the 1910s.', 'In 1912, when Chiang was in Japan, he started to use the name Chiang Kai-shek (Chinese: 蔣介石; pinyin: Jiǎng Jièshí; Wade–Giles: Chiang3 Chieh4-shih2) as a pen name for the articles that he published in a Chinese magazine he founded: Voice of the Army (軍聲). Jieshi is the pinyin romanization of this name, based on Standard Chinese, but the most recognized romanized rendering is Kai-shek which is in Cantonese[3] romanization. Because the Republic of China was based in Canton (a Cantonese-speaking area), Chiang (who never spoke Cantonese but was a native Wu speaker) became known by Westerners under the Cantonese romanisation of his courtesy name, while the family name as known in English seems to be the Mandarin pronunciation of his Chinese family name, transliterated in Wade–Giles.', '""Kai-shek"" soon became Chiang\'s courtesy name (字). Some think the name was chosen from the classic Chinese book the I Ching; ""介于石""; \'[he who is] firm as a rock\', is the beginning of line 2 of Hexagram 16, ""豫"". Others note that the first character of his courtesy name is also the first character of the courtesy name of his brother and other male relatives on the same generational line, while the second character of his courtesy name shih (石—meaning ""stone"") suggests the second character of his ""register name"" tai (泰—the famous Mount Tai). Courtesy names in China often bore a connection with the personal name of the person. As the courtesy name is the name used by people of the same generation to address the person, Chiang soon became known under this new name.', 'Sometime in 1917 or 1918, as Chiang became close to Sun Yat-sen, he changed his name from Chiang Chih-ch‘ing to Chiang Chung-cheng (Chinese: 蔣中正; pinyin: Jiǎng Zhōngzhèng; Wade–Giles: Chiang3 Chung1-cheng4).[citation needed] By adopting the name Chung-cheng, he was choosing a name very similar to the name of Sun Yat-sen, who is known among Chinese as Chung-shan (中山—meaning ""central mountain""), thus establishing a link between the two. The meaning of uprightness, rectitude, or orthodoxy, implied by his name, also positioned him as the legitimate heir of Sun Yat-sen and his ideas. It was readily accepted by members of the Kuomintang, and is the name under which Chiang is still commonly known in Taiwan. Often the name is shortened to ""Chung-cheng"" only. Many public places in Taiwan are named Chungcheng after Chiang. For many years passengers arriving at the Chiang Kai-shek International Airport were greeted by signs in Chinese welcoming them to the ""Chung Cheng International Airport"". Similarly, the monument erected to Chiang\'s memory in Taipei, known in English as Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, was named ""Chung Cheng Memorial Hall"" in Chinese. In Singapore, Chung Cheng High School was named after him.', 'His name is also written in the free area of the Republic of China as ""The Late President Honorable Chiang"" (先總統   蔣公), where the one-character-wide space in front of his name known as Nuo tai shows respect. He is often called Honorable Chiang.', 'The ""Chiang Kai-shek"" in this article is spelled using a Cantonese transliteration he adopted as opposed to Hanyu Pinyin,[4] though pinyin was adopted by the Republic of China government in 2009 as its official romanization.', 'Chiang was born on 31 October 1887, in Hsikow, a town in Fenghua, Zhejiang, China,[5] about 30 kilometers (19\xa0mi) west of central Ningbo. He was born into a family of Wu Chinese-speaking people with their ancestral home—a concept important in Chinese society—in Heqiao, a town in Yixing, Jiangsu, about 38\xa0km (24\xa0mi) southwest of central Wuxi and 10\xa0km (6.2\xa0mi) from the shores of Lake Tai. He was the third child and second son of his father Chiang Chao-Tsung\xa0[zh] (also Chiang Su-an;[6] 1842–1895;[7] 蔣肇聰) and the first child of his father\'s third[3] wife Wang Tsai-yu\xa0[zh] (1863–1921;[6] 王采玉) who were members of a prosperous family of salt merchants. Chiang\'s father died when he was eight, and he wrote of his mother as the ""embodiment of Confucian virtues"". The young Chiang was inspired throughout his youth by the realization that the reputation of an honored family rested upon his shoulders. He was a naughty child.[8] At a young age he was interested in the military.[9] As he grew older, Chiang became more aware of the issues that surrounded him and in his speech to the Kuomintang in 1945 said:', 'As you all know I was an orphan boy in a poor family. Deprived of any protection after the death of her husband, my mother was exposed to the most ruthless exploitation by neighbouring ruffians and the local gentry. The efforts she made in fighting against the intrigues of these family intruders certainly endowed her child, brought up in such an environment, with an indomitable spirit to fight for justice. I felt throughout my childhood that my mother and I were fighting a helpless lone war. We were alone in a desert, with no available or possible assistance could we look forward to. But our determination was never shaken, nor was hope abandoned.[10]', 'In early 1906, Chiang cut off his queue, the required hairstyle of men during the Ch‘ing dynasty, and had it sent home from school, shocking the people in his hometown.[11]', ""Chiang grew up at a time in which military defeats, natural disasters, famines, revolts, unequal treaties and civil wars had left the Manchu-dominated Ch‘ing dynasty unstable and in debt. Successive demands of the Western powers and Japan since the Opium War had left China owing millions of taels of silver. During his first visit to Japan to pursue a military career from April 1906 to later that year, he describes himself as having strong nationalistic feelings with a desire, among other things, to 'expel the Manchu Ch‘ing and to restore China'.[12] In a 1969 speech, Chiang related a story about his boat trip to Japan at nineteen years old. Another passenger on the ship, a Chinese fellow student who was in the habit of spitting on the floor, was chided by a Chinese sailor who said that Japanese people did not spit on the floor, but instead would spit into a handkerchief. Chiang used the story as an example of how the common man in 1969 Taiwan had not developed the spirit of public sanitation that Japan had.[13] Chiang decided to pursue a military career. He began his military training at the Baoding Military Academy in 1906, the same year Japan left its bimetallic currency standard, devaluing the Japanese yen. He left for Tokyo Shinbu Gakko, a preparatory school for the Imperial Japanese Army Academy intended for Chinese students, in 1907. There, he came under the influence of compatriots to support the revolutionary movement to overthrow the Manchu-dominated Qing dynasty and to set up a Han-dominated Chinese republic. He befriended Chen Qimei, and in 1908 Chen brought Chiang into the Tungmenghui, an important revolutionary brotherhood of the era. Finishing his military schooling at Tokyo Shinbu Gakko, Chiang served in the Imperial Japanese Army from 1909 to 1911."", ""After learning of the Wuchang uprising, Chiang returned to China in 1911, intending to fight as an artillery officer. He served in the revolutionary forces, leading a regiment in Shanghai under his friend and mentor Chen Qimei, as one of Chen's chief lieutenants.[14] In early 1912 a dispute arose between Chen and Tao Chengzhang, an influential member of the Revolutionary Alliance who opposed both Sun Yat-sen and Chen. Tao sought to avoid escalating the quarrel by hiding in a hospital, but Chiang discovered him there. Chen dispatched assassins. Chiang may not have taken part in the assassination, but would later assume responsibility to help Chen avoid trouble. Chen valued Chiang despite Chiang's already legendary temper, regarding such bellicosity as useful in a military leader.[15]"", ""Chiang's friendship with Chen Qimei signaled an association with Shanghai's criminal syndicate (the Green Gang headed by Du Yuesheng and Huang Jinrong). During Chiang's time in Shanghai, the Shanghai International Settlement police observed him and eventually charged him with various felonies. These charges never resulted in a trial, and Chiang was never jailed.[16]"", ""Chiang became a founding member of the Nationalist Party (a forerunner of the KMT) after the success (February 1912) of the 1911 Revolution. After the takeover of the Republican government by Yuan Shikai and the failed Second Revolution in 1913, Chiang, like his KMT comrades, divided his time between exile in Japan and the havens of the Shanghai International Settlement. In Shanghai, Chiang cultivated ties with the city's underworld gangs, which were dominated by the notorious Green Gang and its leader Du Yuesheng. On 18 May 1916 agents of Yuan Shikai assassinated Chen Qimei. Chiang then succeeded Chen as leader of the Chinese Revolutionary Party in Shanghai. Sun Yat-sen's political career reached its lowest point during this time—most of his old Revolutionary Alliance comrades refused to join him in the exiled Chinese Revolutionary Party.[17]"", ""In 1917, Sun Yat-sen moved his base of operations to Canton, where Chiang joined him in 1918. At this time Sun remained largely sidelined; without arms or money, he was soon expelled from the city and exiled again to Shanghai, only to return to Canton with mercenary help in 1920. After his return, a rift developed between Sun, who sought to militarily unify China under the KMT, and Canton Governor Chen Chiung-ming, who wanted to implement a federalist system with Canton as a model province. On 16 June 1922 Ye Ju, a general of Chen's whom Sun had attempted to exile, led an assault on Canton's Presidential Palace.[18] Sun had already fled to the naval yard[19] and boarded the SS Haichi,[20] but his wife narrowly evaded shelling and rifle-fire as she fled.[21] They met on the SS Yungfeng, where Chiang joined them as soon as he could return from Shanghai, where he was ritually mourning his mother's death.[22] For about 50 days, Chiang stayed with Sun, protecting and caring for him and earning his lasting trust. They abandoned their attacks on Chen on 9 August, taking a British ship to Hong Kong and traveling to Shanghai by steamer.[22]"", 'Sun regained control of Canton in early 1923, again with the help of mercenaries from Yunnan and of the Comintern. Undertaking a reform of the KMT, he established a revolutionary government aimed at unifying China under the KMT. That same year Sun sent Chiang to Moscow, where he spent three months studying the Soviet political and military system. There Chiang met Leon Trotsky and other Soviet leaders, but quickly came to the conclusion that the Russian model of government was not suitable for China. Chiang later sent his eldest son, Chiang Ching-Kuo, to study in Russia. After his father\'s split from the First United Front in 1927, Ching-Kuo was retained there, as a hostage until 1937. Chiang wrote in his diary, ""It is not worth it to sacrifice the interest of the country for the sake of my son.""[23][24]', ""When Chiang returned in 1924 Sun appointed him Commandant of the Whampoa Military Academy. Chiang resigned after one month in disagreement with Sun's close cooperation with the Comintern, but returned at Sun's demand, and accepted Chou En-lai as his political commissar. The early years at Whampoa allowed Chiang to cultivate a cadre of young officers loyal to both the KMT and himself."", 'Throughout his rise to power, Chiang also benefited from membership within the nationalist Tien-ti-hui fraternity, to which Sun Yat-sen also belonged, and which remained a source of support during his leadership of the Kuomintang.[25]', ""Sun Yat-sen died on 12 March 1925,[26] creating a power vacuum in the Kuomintang. A contest ensued among Wang Ching-wei, Liao Chung-k‘ai, and Hu Han-min. In August, Liao was assassinated and Hu was arrested for his connections to the murderers. Wang Ching-wei, who had succeeded Sun as chairman of the Canton regime, seemed ascendant but was forced into exile by Chiang following the Canton Coup. The SS Yungfeng, renamed the Chung-shan in Sun's honour, had appeared off Changzhou,[27] the location of the Whampoa Academy, on apparently-falsified orders[28] and amid a series of unusual phone calls trying to ascertain Chiang's location.[29] He initially considered fleeing Guangdong and even booked passage on a Japanese steamer but then decided to use his military connections to declare martial law on 20 March 1926 and to crack down on Communist and Soviet influence over the National Revolutionary Army, the military academy, and the party.[28] The right wing of the party supported him, and Joseph Stalin, anxious to maintain Soviet influence in the area, had his lieutenants agree to Chiang's demands[30] on a reduced Communist presence in the KMT leadership in exchange for certain other concessions.[28] The rapid replacement of leadership enabled Chiang to effectively end civilian oversight of the military after 15 May, though his authority was somewhat limited[30] by the army's own regional composition and divided loyalties."", ""On 5 June 1926, he was named commander-in-chief of the National Revolutionary Army [NRA] [31] and, on 27 July, he finally launched Sun's long-delayed Northern Expedition, aimed at conquering the northern warlords and bringing China together under the KMT."", ""The NRA branched into three divisions: to the west was the returned Wang Jingwei, who led a column to take Wuhan; Bai Chongxi's column went east to take Shanghai; Chiang himself led in the middle route, planning to take Nanjing before pressing ahead to capture Beijing. However, in January 1927, Wang Jingwei and his KMT leftist allies took the city of Wuhan amid much popular mobilization and fanfare. Allied with a number of Chinese Communists and advised by Soviet agent Mikhail Borodin, Wang declared the national government as having moved to Wuhan."", 'In 1927, when he was setting up the Nationalist government in Nanjing, he was preoccupied with ""the elevation of our leader Dr. Sun Yat-sen to the rank of \'Father of our Chinese Republic\'. Dr. Sun worked for 40 years to lead our people in the Nationalist cause, and we cannot allow any other personality to usurp this honored position"". He asked Chen Guofu to purchase a photograph that had been taken in Japan c.\u20091895 or 1898. It showed members of the Revive China Society with Yeung Ku-wan as president, in the place of honor, and Sun, as secretary, on the back row, along with members of the Japanese Chapter of the Revive China Society. When told that it was not for sale, Chiang offered a million dollars to recover the photo and its negative, ""The party must have this picture and the negative at any price. They must be destroyed as soon as possible. It would be embarrassing to have our Father of the Chinese Republic shown in a subordinate position"".[32]', 'On 12 April 1927, Chiang carried out a purge of thousands of suspected Communists and dissidents in Shanghai, and began large-scale massacres across the country collectively known as the ""White Terror"". During April, more than 12,000 people were killed in Shanghai. The killings drove most Communists from urban cities and into the rural countryside, where the KMT was less powerful.[33] In the year after April 1927, over 300,000 people died across China in the anti-communist suppression campaigns, executed by the KMT. One of the most famous quotes from Chiang (during that time) was, that he would rather mistakenly kill 1,000 innocent people, than allow one Communist to escape.[34] Some estimates claim the White Terror in China took millions of lives, most of them in rural areas. No concrete number can be verified.[35] Chiang allowed Soviet agent and advisor Mikhail Borodin and Soviet general Vasily Blücher (Galens) to ""escape"" to safety after the purge.[36]', 'The NRA formed by the KMT swept through southern and central China until it was checked in Shandong, where confrontations with the Japanese garrison escalated into armed conflict. The conflicts were collectively known as the Jinan incident of 1928.', ""Now with an established national government in Nanjing, and supported by conservative allies including Hu Hanmin, Chiang's expulsion of the Communists and their Soviet advisers led to the beginning of the Chinese Civil War. Wang Jingwei's National Government was weak militarily, and was soon ended by Chiang with the support of a local warlord (Li Zongren of Guangxi). Eventually, Wang and his leftist party surrendered to Chiang and joined him in Nanjing. However, the cracks between Chiang and Hu's traditionally Right-Wing KMT faction, the Western Hills Group, began to show soon after the cleansing against the communists, and Chiang later imprisoned Hu."", ""Though Chiang had consolidated the power of the KMT in Nanjing, it was still necessary to capture Beijing to claim the legitimacy needed for international recognition. Beijing was taken in June 1928, from an alliance of the warlords Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan. Yan Xishan moved in and captured Beiping on behalf of his new allegiance after the death of Zhang Zuolin in 1928. His successor, Zhang Xueliang, accepted the authority of the KMT leadership, and the Northern Expedition officially concluded, completing Chiang's nominal unification of China and ending the Warlord Era."", 'After the Northern Expedition ended in 1928, Yan, Feng, Li Zongren and Zhang Fakui broke off relations with Chiang shortly after a demilitarization conference in 1929, and together they formed an anti-Chiang coalition to openly challenge the legitimacy of the Nanjing government. In the Central Plains War, they were defeated.', ""Chiang made great efforts to gain recognition as the official successor of Sun Yat-sen. In a pairing of great political significance, Chiang was Sun's brother-in-law. He had married Soong Mei-ling, the younger sister of Soong Ching-ling, Sun's widow, on 1 December 1927. Originally rebuffed in the early 1920s, Chiang managed to ingratiate himself to some degree with Soong Mei-ling's mother by first divorcing his wife and concubines and promising to sincerely study the precepts of Christianity. He read the copy of the Bible that May-ling had given him twice before making up his mind to become a Christian, and three years after his marriage he was baptized in the Soong's Methodist church. Although some observers felt that he adopted Christianity as a political move, studies of his recently opened diaries suggest that his faith was strong and sincere and that he felt that Christianity reinforced Confucian moral teachings.[37]"", 'Upon reaching Beijing, Chiang paid homage to Sun Yat-sen and had his body moved to the new capital of Nanjing to be enshrined in a mausoleum, the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum.', 'In the West and in the Soviet Union, Chiang Kai-shek was known as the ""Red General"".[38] Movie theaters in the Soviet Union showed newsreels and clips of Chiang. At Moscow, Sun Yat-sen University portraits of Chiang were hung on the walls; and, in the Soviet May Day parades that year, Chiang\'s portrait was to be carried along with the portraits of Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, and other Communist leaders.[39] The United States consulate and other Westerners in Shanghai were concerned about the approach of ""Red General"" Chiang as his army was seizing control of large areas of the country in the Northern Expedition.[40][41]', 'Having gained control of China, Chiang\'s party remained surrounded by defeated warlords who remained relatively autonomous within their own regions. On 10 October 1928, Chiang was named director of the State Council, the equivalent to President of the country, in addition to his other titles.[42] As with his predecessor Sun Yat-sen, the Western media dubbed him ""generalissimo"".[31]', 'According to Sun Yat-sen\'s plans, the KMT was to rebuild China in three steps: military rule, political tutelage, and constitutional rule. The ultimate goal of the KMT revolution was democracy, which was not considered to be feasible in China\'s fragmented state. Since the KMT had completed the first step of revolution through seizure of power in 1928, Chiang\'s rule thus began a period of what his party considered to be ""political tutelage"" in Sun Yat-sen\'s name. During this so-called Republican Era, many features of a modern, functional Chinese state emerged and developed.', 'From 1928 to 1937, known as the Nanjing decade, various aspects of foreign imperialism, concessions and privileges in China were moderated by diplomacy.[43] The government acted to modernize the legal and penal systems and attempted to stabilize prices, amortize debts, reform the banking and currency systems, build railroads and highways, improve public health facilities, legislate against traffic in narcotics, and augment industrial and agricultural production. Efforts were made to improve education standards, and the national academy of sciences, Academia Sinica, was founded.[44] In an effort to unify Chinese society, the New Life Movement was launched to encourage Confucian moral values and personal discipline. Guoyu (""national language"") was promoted as the official language, and the establishment of communications facilities (including radio) was used to encourage a sense of Chinese nationalism in a way that had not been possible when the nation lacked an effective central government. Under that context, the Chinese Rural Reconstruction Movement was implemented by some social activists who graduated as professors of the United States with tangible but limited progress in modernizing the tax, infrastructural, economic, cultural, and educational equipment and the mechanisms of rural regions. The social activists actively co-ordinated with the local governments in the towns and villages since the early 1930s. However, the policy was subsequently neglected and canceled by Chiang\'s government because of rampant wars and the lack of resources after the Japanese War and the civil war.[45][46]', ""Despite being a conservative, Chiang supported modernization policies such as scientific advancement, universal education, and women's rights. The Kuomintang supported women's suffrage and education and the abolition of polygamy and foot binding. Under Chiang's leadership, the Republic of China government also enacted a women's quota in the parliament, with reserved seats for women. During the Nanjing Decade, average Chinese citizens received education that they had been denied by the dynasties. That increased the literacy rate across China and also promoted the ideals of Tridemism of democracy, republicanism, science, constitutionalism, and Chinese nationalism based on the Dang Guo of the KMT.[47][48][49][50][51]"", ""Any successes that the Nationalists achieved, however, were met with constant political and military upheavals. Many of the urban areas were now under the control of the KMT, but much of the countryside remained under the influence of weakened-but-undefeated warlords, landlords, and Communists. Chiang often resolved issues of warlord obstinacy through military action, but such action was costly in terms of men and material. The Central Plains War alone nearly bankrupted the Nationalist government and caused almost 250,000 casualties on both sides. In 1931, Hu Hanmin, an old supporter of Chiang, publicly voiced a popular concern that Chiang's position as both premier and president flew in the face of the democratic ideals of the Nationalist government. Chiang had Hu put under house arrest, but Hu was released after national condemnation. Hu then left Nanjing and supported a rival government in Canton. The split resulted in a military conflict between Hu's Guangdong government and Chiang's Nationalist government."", ""Throughout his rule, complete eradication of the Communists remained Chiang's dream. After he had assembled his forces in Jiangxi, Chiang led his armies against the newly established Chinese Soviet Republic. With help from foreign military advisers such as Max Bauer and Alexander von Falkenhausen, Chiang's Fifth Campaign finally surrounded the Chinese Red Army in 1934.[52] The Communists, tipped off that a Nationalist offensive was imminent, retreated in the Long March during which Mao rose from a mere military official to the most influential leader of the Chinese Communist Party."", 'Some academics and historians have classified Chiang\'s rule as fascist.[53][54][55] The New Life Movement, initiated by Chiang, was based upon Confucianism mixed with Christianity, nationalism, and authoritarianism that have some similarities to fascism. Frederic Wakeman argued that the New Life Movement was ""Confucian fascism"".[56] Chiang also sponsored the creation of the Blue Shirts Society, in conscious imitation of the Blackshirts in the Italian Fascist Party[57] and the Sturmabteilung of the Nazi Party.[58] Its ideology was to expel foreign (Japanese and Western) imperialists from China and to crush communism.[59] Close ties with Nazi Germany also gave the Nationalist government access to German military and economic assistance during the mid-1930s.[60]:\u200a64\u200a In a 1935 speech, Chiang stated that ""fascism is what China now most needs"" and described fascism as the stimulant for a declining society.[60]:\u200a64\u200a Mao once derogatorily compared Chiang to Adolf Hitler, referring to him as the ""Führer of China"".[61] Sino-German relations rapidly deteriorated as Germany grew closer to Japan and almost completely broke down when Japan launched a full-scale invasion of China in 1937, which Germany failed to mediate. However, China did not declare war on Germany, Italy, or even Japan until after the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941.[62]', 'Chinese Communists and many conservative anti-communist writers have argued that Chiang was pro-capitalist based on the alliance thesis (the alliance between Chiang and the capitalists to purge the communist and the leftist elements in Shanghai, as well as in the resulting civil war). However, Chiang also antagonized the capitalists of Shanghai by often attacking them and confiscating their capital and assets for government use even while he denounced and fought against communists. Critics have called that ""bureaucratic capitalism"".[63][64] Historian Parks M. Coble argues that the phrase ""bureaucratic capitalism"" is too simplistic to adequately characterize this phenomenon. Instead, he says, the regime weakened all social forces so that the government could pursue policies without being responsible nor responsive to any outside political groups. By defeating any potential challenge to its power, government officials could amass sizable fortunes. With that motive, Chiang cracked down pro-communist worker and peasant organizations, as well as rich Shanghai capitalists. Chiang also continued the anti-capitalist rhetoric of Sun Yat-sen and directed the Kuomintang media to attack the capitalists and capitalism openly. He supported government-controlled industries instead. Coble says that the rhetoric had no impact on governmental policy and that its use was to prevent the capitalists from claiming legitimacy within the party or society and to control them and their wealth.[64]', 'Authority within the Nationalist government ultimately lay with Chiang.[65]:\u200a43\u200a All major policy changes on military, diplomatic, or economic issues required his approval.[65]:\u200a156\u200a According to historian Odd Arne Westad, ""no other leader within the [KMT] had the authority to force through even the simplest decisions.[65]:\u200a156\u200a The practical power of high-ranking officials like ministers or the head of the Executive Yuan was more closely tied to their relationship with Chiang than with the formal authority of their position.[65]:\u200a43\u200a Chiang created multiple layers of power in his administration which he sometimes played off against each other to prevent individuals or cliques from gathering power that could oppose his authority.[65]:\u200a93–94\u200a', 'Contrary to the critique that Chiang was highly corrupt, he was not involved in corruption himself.[66] However his wife, Soong Mei-ling, ignored her family\'s involvement in corruption.[67] The Soong family embezzled $20 million in the course of the 1930s and the 1940s when the Nationalist government\'s revenues were less than $30 million per year.[68]:\u200a40\u200a The Soong family\'s eldest son, T.V. Soong, was the Chinese premier and finance minister, and the eldest daughter, Soong Ai-ling, was the wife of Kung Hsiang-hsi, the wealthiest man in China. The second daughter, Soong Ching-ling, was the wife of Sun Yat-sen, China\'s founding father. The youngest daughter, Soong Mei-ling, married Chiang in 1927, and following the marriage, both families became intimately connected, which created the ""Soong dynasty"" and the ""Four Families"". However, Soong was also credited for her campaign for women\'s rights in China, including her attempts to improve the education, culture, and social benefits of Chinese women.[67] Critics have said that the ""Four Families"" monopolized the regime and looted it.[63] The US sent considerable aid to the Nationalist government but soon realized the widespread corruption. Military supplies that were sent appeared on the black market. Significant sums of money that had been transmitted through T. V. Soong, China\'s finance minister, soon disappeared. President Truman famously referred to the Nationalist leaders, ""They\'re thieves, every damn one of them."" He also said, ""They stole $750 million out of the billions that we sent to Chiang. They stole it, and it\'s invested in real estate down in São Paolo and some right here in New York.""[69][70] Soong Mei-ling and Soong Ai-ling lived luxurious lifestyles and held millions in property, clothes, art, and jewelry.[71] Soong Ai-ling and Soong Mei-ling were also the two richest women in China.[72] Despite living a luxurious life for almost her entire life, Soong Mei-ling left only a $120,000 inheritance, and the reason is that according to her niece, that she donated most of her wealth when she was still alive.[73] Chiang, requiring support, tolerated corruption with people in his inner circles, as well as high-ranking nationalist officials, but not of lower-ranking officers. In 1934, he ordered seven military officers who embezzled state property to be shot. In another case, several division commanders pleaded with Chiang to pardon a criminal officer, but as soon as the division commanders had left, Chiang ordered him shot.[66] The deputy editor and chief reporter at the Central Daily News, Lu Keng, made headline international news by exposing the corruption of two senior officials, Kong Xiangxi (H. H. Kung) and T. V. Soong. Chiang then ordered a thorough investigation of the Central Daily News to find the source. However, Lu, risked execution by refusing to comply and protecting his journalists. Chiang wanting to avoid an international response and so jailed Lu instead.[74][75] Chiang realized the widespread problems that corruption was creating and so he undertook several anti-corruption campaigns before and after World War II with varying success. Before the war, both campaigns, the Nanjing Decade Cleanup of 1927–1930 and the Wartime Reform Movement of 1944–1947, failed. After the World War II and the Civil War, both campaigns, the Kuomintang Reconstruction of 1950–1952 and the Governmental Rejuvenation of 1969–1973, succeeded.[76]', 'Chiang, who viewed all of the foreign great powers with suspicion, wrote in a letter that they ""all have it in their minds to promote the interests of their own respective countries at the cost of other nations"" and saw it as hypocritical for any of them to condemn one another\'s foreign policy.[77][78] He used diplomatic persuasion on the United States, Nazi Germany, and the Soviet Union to regain lost Chinese territories, as he viewed all foreign powers as imperialists that were attempting to exploit China.[79]', 'During April 1931, Chiang Kai-shek attended a national leadership conference in Nanjing with Zhang Xueliang and General Ma Fuxiang during which Chiang and Zhang dauntlessly upheld that Manchuria was part of China in the face of the Japanese invasion.[80] After the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931, Chiang resigned as Chairman of the National Government. He returned shortly afterward and adopted the slogan ""first internal pacification, then external resistance."" However, his policy of avoiding a frontal war against Japan and prioritizing anti-communist suppression was widely unpopular and provoked nationwide protests.[81] In 1932, while Chiang was seeking first to defeat the Communists, Japan launched an advance on Shanghai and bombarded Nanjing. That disrupted Chiang\'s offensives against the Communists for a time, but it was the northern factions of Hu Hanmin\'s Guangdong government (notably the 19th Route Army) that primarily led the offensive against the Japanese during the skirmish. Brought into the NRA immediately after the battle, the 19th Route Army\'s career under Chiang would be cut short by being disbanded for demonstrating socialist tendencies. [citation needed]', 'In December 1936, Chiang flew to Xi\'an to co-ordinate a major assault on the Red Army and the CPC, which had retreated into Yan\'an. However, Chiang\'s allied commander Zhang Xueliang, whose forces were used in his attack and whose homeland of Manchuria had been recently invaded by the Japanese, did not support the attack on the Communists. On 12 December, Zhang and several other Nationalist generals, headed by Yang Hucheng of Shaanxi kidnapped Chiang for two weeks in what is known as the Xi\'an Incident. They forced Chiang into making a ""Second United Front"" with the Communists against Japan. After releasing Chiang and returning to Nanjing with him, Zhang was placed under house arrest, and the generals who had assisted him were executed.

Among the Kuomintang Generals present were the Muslim Generals Bai Chongxi and Ma Fuxiang.[161]"", 'Chiang Kai-shek considered both Han Chinese and all ethnic minorities of China, the Five Races Under One Union, as descendants of the Yellow Emperor, the mythical founder of the Chinese nation, and belonging to the Chinese Nation Zhonghua Minzu. He introduced this into Kuomintang ideology which was propagated into the educational system of the Republic of China.[162][163][164]', ""Chiang, as a Chinese nationalist and a Confucian, was against the iconoclasm of the May Fourth Movement. Motivated by his sense of nationalism, he viewed some Western ideas as foreign and believed that the great introduction of Western ideas and literature, which the May Fourth Movement promoted, was not beneficial to China. He and Sun criticized the May Fourth intellectuals as corrupting the morals of China's youth.[165]"", 'Chiang Kai-shek once said:', 'If when I die, I am still a dictator, I will certainly go down into the oblivion of all dictators. If, on the other hand, I succeed in establishing a truly stable foundation for a democratic government, I will live forever in every home in China.[166]', 'Chiang\'s legacy has been subjected to heated debates. For some, Chiang was a national hero who led the victorious Northern Expedition against the Beiyang warlords in 1927 and helped achieve Chinese unification. His initial image as the leader of China against Japan\'s invasion, both before and after the attack on Pearl Harbor, led him to be featured on the cover of Time magazine ten times. Even though China received little American aid compared to Britain and the Soviet Union, it did not fold, as Chiang called on his countrymen to fight to the ""bitter end"" until their ultimate victory against Japan in 1945.[167]', ""Some also see him as a champion of anti-communism, being a key figure during the formative years of the World Anti-Communist League. During the subsequent Cold War, he was seen as the leader who led Free China and the bulwark against a possible communist invasion. However, historian Rudolph Rummel documented that the Nationalist government under Chiang led to millions of excess deaths from calamities such as its persecution against actual or perceived communists and its conscription of soldiers, confiscation of food, and flooding of downstream regions of the Yellow River during the Second Sino-Japanese War.[168] His government was also accused of being corrupt and allying with known criminals such as Du Yuesheng for political and financial gains, and his critics often accuse him of fascism.[54] In Taiwan, he ruled throughout a period of martial law. Some opponents charge that Chiang's efforts in developing the island were mostly to turn it into a strong base from which to recover mainland China and that he had little regard for the Taiwanese people."", ""Unlike Chiang's son Chiang Ching-kuo, who is respected across the political spectrum, Chiang Kai-shek's image is perceived rather negatively in Taiwan. He was rated the lowest in two opinion polls about the perception of former presidents.[169][170] His popularity in Taiwan is divided along political lines, enjoying better support in the Kuomintang (KMT) while being widely unpopular among Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) voters and those who blame him for the thousands killed during the February 28 Incident and criticise his dictatorial rule.[171]"", 'In contrast, his image has partially improved in mainland China. He had been portrayed as a villain and a ""bourgeoisie reactionary lackey"" who fought against the ""liberation"" of China by the communists, but since the 2000s, the media and popular culture have depicted him in a less negative manner.[172][173] For example, many praised the 2009 movie sponsored by the Chinese Communist Party, The Founding of a Republic, for moving away from casting Chiang as \'evil\' versus Mao and emphasizing instead that the contingencies of war led the communists to victory.[174] In the context of the Second Sino-Japanese War, aspects of Chiang\'s trip to India, or meeting with Roosevelt and Churchill in Cairo can be viewed positively.[65]:\u200a4\u200a The shift also takes into account Chiang\'s commitment to a unified China and his stance against Taiwanese separatism.[175] Chiang\'s ancestral home in Fenghua, Zhejiang, has become a museum and tourist attraction.[176] Historian Rana Mitter notes that the displays inside were very positive about Chiang\'s role during the Second Sino-Japanese War.[173][177]', 'Mitter further observed that, ironically, today\'s China is closer to Chiang\'s vision than to Mao\'s and wrote, ""One can imagine Chiang Kai-shek\'s ghost wandering round China today nodding in approval, while Mao\'s ghost follows behind him, moaning at the destruction of his vision"".[178][179] Liang Shuming opined that Chiang Kai-shek\'s ""greatest contribution was to make the CCP successful. If he had been a bit more trustworthy, if his character was somewhat better, the CCP would have been unable to beat him"".[180] Some Chinese historians argue that the main determinants for Chiang\'s defeat were not corruption or the lack of US support, but his decision to start the civil war with 70% of government expenditures in the military, his overestimation of the Nationalist forces equipped with US arms, and the loss of popularity and morales of his soldiers.[181] Other historians argue that his failure was largely caused by external factors outside of Chiang\'s control. They include the refusal of the Truman administration to support Chiang by withdrawing aid, the foisting of an arms embargo by George C. Marshall, the failed pursuit of a détente between the nationalists and the communists, the American push for a coalition government with the CCP, and the USSR\'s consistent aid and support for the CCP during the civil war.[112][182][183][184]', 'In the United States and Europe, Chiang was often perceived negatively as the one who lost China to the communists. His persistent demands for United States support and funding also prompted jokes from American officials that Chiang\'s name was actually General ""Cash-My-Check"".[65]:\u200a33\u200a He has also been criticized for his poor military skills, such as issuing unrealistic orders and persistently attempting to fight unwinnable battles, leading to the loss of his best troops.[185] In recent years, Chiang\'s image has been somewhat rehabilitated, and he has been increasingly perceived as a man overwhelmed by the events in China, having to fight the communists, Japanese, and provincial warlords simultaneously while trying to reconstruct and unify the country. His sincere, albeit often unsuccessful attempts to build a more powerful and modern nation have been noted by scholars such as Jonathan Fenby, Rana Mitter, and biographer Jay Taylor.[186]', ""In 1901, in an arranged marriage at age 14,[187] Chiang was married to Mao Fumei,  an illiterate villager five years his senior.[188] While married to Mao, Chiang adopted two concubines (concubinage was still a common practice for well-to-do, non-Christian males in China): he took Yao Yecheng (姚冶誠, 1887–1966) as concubine in late 1912[189] and married Chen Jieru (1906–1971)[190] in December 1921. While he was still living in Shanghai, Chiang and Yao adopted a son, Wei-kuo. Chen adopted a daughter in 1924, named Yaoguang, who later adopted her mother's surname. Chen's autobiography refuted the idea that she was a concubine.[191] Chen claiming that, by the time she married Chiang, he had already divorced Yao, and that Chen was therefore his wife. Chiang and Mao had a son, Ching-kuo."", ""According to the memoirs of Chen Jieru, Chiang's second wife, she contracted gonorrhea from Chiang soon after their marriage. He told her that he acquired this disease after separating from his first wife and living with his concubine Yao Yecheng, as well as with many other women he consorted with. His doctor explained to her that Chiang had sex with her before completing his treatment for the disease. As a result, both Chiang and Chen Jieru believed that they had become sterile; however, a purported miscarriage by Soong Mei-ling in August 1928 would, if it actually occurred, cast serious doubt on whether this was true.[40][192]"", ""The Xikou Chiangs were descended from Chiang Shih-chieh, who during the 1600s moved there from Fenghua district, and whose ancestors in turn came to southeastern China's Zhejiang (Chekiang) province after moving out of Northern China in the 13th century CE. The 12th century BCE Duke of Zhou's (Duke of Chou) third son was the ancestors of the Chiangs.[193][194][195][196][197]"", 'His great-grandfather was Chiang Qi-zeng, his grandfather was Chiang Si-qian, his uncle was Chiang Zhao-hai, and his father was Chiang Zhao-cong.[198][199]', 'Chiang personally dealt extensively with religions, power figures, and factions in China during his regime.', 'Chiang Kai-shek was born and raised as a Buddhist, but became a Methodist upon his marriage to his fourth wife, Soong Mei-ling. It was previously believed that this was a political move,[200] but further studies of his personal diaries suggest that his faith was sincere.[37]', ""Chiang developed relationships with other generals. Chiang became a sworn brother of the Chinese Muslim general Ma Fuxiang and appointed him to high ranking positions. Chiang addressed Ma Fuxiang's son Ma Hongkui as Shao Yun Shixiong[201] Ma Fuxiang attended national leadership conferences with Chiang during battles against Japan.[202] Ma Hongkui was eventually scapegoated for the failure of the Ningxia Campaign against the Communists, so he moved to the US instead of remaining in Taiwan with Chiang."", 'When Chiang became President of China after the Northern Expedition, he carved out Ningxia and Qinghai out of Gansu province, and appointed Muslim generals as military governors of all three provinces: Ma Hongkui, Ma Hongbin, and Ma Qi. The three Muslim governors, known as Xibei San Ma (lit. ""the three Mas of the Northwest""), controlled armies composed entirely of Muslims. Chiang called on the three and their subordinates to wage war against the Soviet peoples, Tibetans, Communists, and the Japanese. Chiang continued to appoint Muslims as governors of the three provinces, including Ma Lin and Ma Fushou. Chiang\'s appointments, the first time that Muslims had been appointed as governors of Gansu, increased the prestige of Muslim officials in northwestern China. The armies raised by this ""Ma Clique"", most notably their Muslim cavalry, were incorporated into the KMT army. Chiang appointed Hui general Bai Chongxi as the Minister of National Defence of the Republic of China, which controlled the ROC military.', ""Chiang also supported the Muslim General Ma Zhongying, whom he had trained at Whampoa Military Academy during the Kumul Rebellion, in a jihad against Jin Shuren, Sheng Shicai, and the Soviet Union during the Soviet Invasion of Xinjiang. Chiang designated Ma's Muslim army as the 36th Division (National Revolutionary Army) and gave his troops KMT flags and uniforms. Chiang then supported Muslim General Ma Hushan against Sheng and the Soviet Union in the Xinjiang War (1937). All Muslim generals commissioned by Chiang in the National Revolutionary Army swore allegiance to him. Several, like Ma Shaowu and Ma Hushan were loyal to Chiang and Kuomintang hardliners."", ""The Ili Rebellion and Pei-ta-shan Incident plagued relations with the Soviet Union during Chiang's rule and caused trouble with the Uyghurs. During the Ili Rebellion and Peitashan incident, Chiang deployed Hui troops against Uyghur mobs in Turfan, and against Soviet Russian and Mongols at Peitashan."", ""During Chiang's rule, attacks on foreigners and ethnic minorities by the allied warlords of the Nationalist government such as the Ma Clique flared up in several incidents. One of these was the Battle of Kashgar where a Muslim army loyal to the Kuomintang massacred 4,500 Uyghurs, and killed several Britons at the British consulate in Kashgar.[203]"", ""Hu Songshan, a Muslim Imam, backed Chiang Kai-shek's regime and gave prayers for his government. ROC flags were saluted by Muslims in Ningxia during prayer along with exhortations to nationalism during Chiang's rule. Chiang sent Muslim students abroad to study at places like Al-Azhar University and Muslim schools throughout China that taught loyalty to his regime."", 'The Yuehua, a Chinese Muslim publication, quoted the Quran and hadith to justify submitting to Chiang Kai-shek as the leader of China, and as justification for Jihad in the war against Japan.[204]', ""The Yihewani (Ikhwan al Muslimun a.k.a. Muslim brotherhood) was the predominant Muslim sect backed by the Chiang government during Chiang's regime. Other Muslim sects, like the Xidaotang and Sufi brotherhoods like Jahriyya and Khuffiya were also supported by his regime. The Chinese Muslim Association, a pro-Kuomintang and anti-Communist organization, was set up by Muslims working in his regime. Salafists attempted to gain a foothold in China during his regime, but the Yihewani and Hanafi Sunni Gedimu denounced the Salafis as radicals, engaged in fights against them, and declared them heretics, forcing the Salafis to form a separate sect.[205][206][207][208] Ma Ching-chiang, a Muslim General, served as an advisor to Chiang Kai-shek.

He fought against them in the Sino-Tibetan War, and he supported the Muslim General Ma Bufang in his war against Tibetan rebels in Qinghai. Chiang ordered Ma Bufang to prepare his Islamic army to invade Tibet several times, to deter Tibetan independence, and threatened the Tibetans with aerial bombardment. Ma Bufang attacked the Tibetan Buddhist Tsang monastery in 1941.[90] After the war, Chiang appointed Ma Bufang as ambassador to Saudi Arabia.', 'Chiang incorporated Methodist values into the New Life Movement under the influence of his wife.

Joseph_Stalin,"['Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin[f] (born Dzhugashvili;[g] 18 December\xa0[O.S. 6 December]\xa01878\xa0– 5 March 1953) was a Soviet politician and revolutionary who led the Soviet Union from 1924 until his death in 1953. He held power as General Secretary of the Communist Party from 1922 to 1952 and as Chairman of the Council of Ministers from 1941 until his death. Initially governing as part of a collective leadership, Stalin consolidated power to become a dictator by the 1930s. He codified his Leninist interpretation of Marxism as Marxism–Leninism, while the totalitarian political system he established became known as Stalinism.', 'Born into a poor Georgian family in Gori, Russian Empire, Stalin attended the Tiflis Theological Seminary before joining the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. He raised funds for Vladimir Lenin\'s Bolshevik faction through robberies, kidnappings and protection rackets, and edited the party\'s newspaper, Pravda. Repeatedly arrested, he underwent internal exiles to Siberia. After the Bolsheviks seized power in the October Revolution of 1917, Stalin joined the governing Politburo, and following Lenin\'s death in 1924, won the struggle to lead the country. Under Stalin, the doctrine of socialism in one country became central to the party\'s ideology. His five-year plans, launched in 1928, led to agricultural collectivisation and rapid industrialisation, establishing a centralised command economy. Resulting disruptions to food production contributed to a famine in 1932–1933 which killed millions, including in the Holodomor in Ukraine. Between 1936 and 1938, Stalin eradicated his political opponents and those deemed ""enemies of the working class"" in the Great Purge, after which he had absolute control of the party and government. Under his regime, an estimated 18 million people passed through the Gulag system of forced labour camps, and more than six million were deported to remote regions of the Soviet Union, which together resulted in millions of deaths. ', 'Stalin promoted Marxism–Leninism abroad through the Communist International and supported European anti-fascist movements, including in the Spanish Civil War. In 1939, his government signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact with Nazi Germany, enabling the Soviet invasion of Poland. Germany broke the pact by invading the Soviet Union in 1941, leading Stalin to join the Allies of World War II. Despite huge losses, the Soviet Red Army repelled the German invasion and captured Berlin in 1945, ending the war in Europe. The Soviet Union, which had annexed the Baltic states and territories from Finland and Romania amid the war, established Soviet-aligned states in Central and Eastern Europe. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as global superpowers, and entered a period of tension known as the Cold War. Stalin presided over post-war reconstruction and the first Soviet atomic bomb test in 1949. During these years, the country experienced another famine and a state-sponsored antisemitic campaign culminating in the ""doctors\' plot"". In 1953, Stalin died after suffering a stroke, and was succeeded as leader by Georgy Malenkov and later by Nikita Khrushchev, who in 1956 denounced Stalin\'s rule and initiated a campaign of ""de-Stalinisation"".', ""Widely considered one of the 20th century's most significant figures, Stalin was the subject of a pervasive personality cult within the international Marxist–Leninist movement, which revered him as a champion of socialism and the working class. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Stalin has retained a degree of popularity in post-Soviet states as an economic moderniser and victorious wartime leader who cemented the Soviet Union as a major world power. Conversely, his regime has been widely condemned for overseeing mass repressions, ethnic cleansing, and famines which caused the deaths of millions."", ""Stalin was born on 18 December\xa0[O.S. 6 December]\xa01878[h] in Gori, Georgia,[2] then part of the Tiflis Governorate of the Russian Empire.[3][4] An ethnic Georgian, his birth name was Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili (Russified as Iosif Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili).[g] His parents were Besarion Jughashvili and Ekaterine Geladze;[5] Stalin was their third child and the only one to survive past infancy.[6] After Besarion's shoemaking workshop went into decline, the family fell into poverty, and he became an alcoholic who beat his wife and son.[7][8] Ekaterine and her son left the home by 1883, moving through nine different rented rooms.[9] In 1888, Stalin enrolled at the Gori Church School[10][11] where he excelled.[12] He faced health problems: an 1884 smallpox infection left him with facial scars,[13] and at age 12 he was seriously injured when he was struck by a phaeton, causing a lifelong disability in his left arm.[14]"", 'In 1894, Stalin enrolled as a trainee Russian Orthodox priest at the Tiflis Theological Seminary, enabled by a scholarship.[15] He initially achieved high grades,[16] but lost interest in his studies.[17][18] Stalin became influenced by Nikolay Chernyshevsky\'s pro-revolutionary novel What Is To Be Done?,[19] and Alexander Kazbegi\'s The Patricide, with Stalin adopting the nickname ""Koba"" from its bandit protagonist.[20] After reading Das Kapital, Stalin focused on Karl Marx\'s philosophy of Marxism,[21] which was on the rise as a variety of socialism opposed to the Tsarist authorities.[22] He began attending secret workers\' meetings,[23] and left the seminary in April 1899.[24]', ""During October 1899, he worked as a meteorologist at the Tiflis observatory.[25] He attracted a group of socialist supporters,[26] and co-organised a secret workers' meeting[27] where he convinced many to strike on May Day 1900.[28] The empire's secret police, the Okhrana, became aware of Stalin's activities and attempted to arrest him in March 1901, but he went into hiding[29] during which he lived off donations from friends.[30] He helped plan a demonstration in Tiflis on May Day 1901 at which 3,000 marchers clashed with the authorities.[31] Stalin was elected to the Tiflis Committee of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) –a Marxist party founded in 1898– in November 1901.[32]"", 'That month, he travelled to Batumi.[33] His militant rhetoric proved divisive among the city\'s Marxists, some of whom suspected that he was an agent provocateur.[34] Stalin began working at the Rothschild refinery storehouse, where he co-organised two workers\' strikes.[35] After the strike leaders were arrested, he co-organised a mass demonstration which led to the storming of the prison.[36] Stalin was arrested in April 1902[37] and sentenced to three years exile in Siberia, arriving in Novaya Uda in November 1903.[38] After one failed attempt, Stalin escaped from his exile in January 1904 and travelled to Tiflis,[39] where he co-edited the Marxist newspaper Proletariatis Brdzola (""Proletarian Struggle"") with Filipp Makharadze.[40] During his exile, the RSDLP had become divided between Vladimir Lenin\'s ""Bolshevik"" faction and Julius Martov\'s ""Mensheviks"".[41] Stalin, who detested many Mensheviks in Georgia, aligned himself with the Bolsheviks.[42]', 'In January 1905, government troops massacred protesters in Saint Petersburg spreading across the Empire in the Revolution of 1905.[43] Stalin was in Baku in February when ethnic violence broke out between Armenians and Azeris,[44] and he formed Bolshevik ""battle squads"" which he used to keep the city\'s warring ethnic factions apart.[45] His armed squads attacked local police and troops,[46] raided arsenals,[47] and raised funds via protection rackets.[48][49] In November 1905, the Georgian Bolsheviks elected Stalin as one of their delegates to a Bolshevik conference in Tampere, Finland,[50] where he met Lenin.[51] Although Stalin held Lenin in deep respect, he vocally disagreed with his view that the Bolsheviks should field candidates for the 1906 election to the State Duma; Stalin viewed parliamentary process as a waste of time.[52] In April 1906, he attended the RSDLP\'s Fourth Congress in Stockholm, where the party—then led by a Menshevik majority—agreed that it would not raise funds using armed robbery.[53] Lenin and Stalin disagreed with this,[54] and privately discussed continuing the robberies for the Bolshevik cause.[55]', 'Stalin married Kato Svanidze in July 1906,[56] and in March 1907 she gave birth to their son Yakov.[57] Stalin, who by now had established himself as ""Georgia\'s leading Bolshevik"",[58] in June 1907 organised the robbery of a bank stagecoach in Tiflis to fund the Bolsheviks\'. His operatives ambushed the convoy in Erivansky Square with guns and home-made bombs; around 40 people were killed.[59] Stalin settled in Baku with his wife and son,[60] where Mensheviks confronted him about the robbery and voted to expel him from the RSDLP, but he ignored them.[61] Stalin secured Bolshevik domination of Baku\'s RSDLP branch[62] and edited two Bolshevik newspapers.[63] In November 1907, his wife died of typhus,[64] and he left his son with her family in Tiflis.[65] In Baku he reassembled his gang,[66] which attacked Black Hundreds and raised money through racketeering, counterfeiting, robberies[67] and kidnapping the children of wealthy figures for ransom.[68]', 'In March 1908, Stalin was arrested and imprisoned in Baku.[69] He led the imprisoned Bolsheviks, organised discussion groups, and ordered the killing of suspected informants.[70] He was sentenced to two years of exile in Solvychegodsk in northern Russia, arriving there in February 1909.[71] In June, Stalin escaped to Saint Petersburg,[72] but was arrested again in March 1910 and sent back to Solvychegodsk.[73] In June 1911, Stalin was given permission to move to Vologda where he stayed for two months.[74] He then escaped to Saint Petersburg,[75] where he was arrested again in September 1911 and sentenced to a further three years of exile in Vologda.[76]', 'In January 1912, the first Bolshevik Central Committee was elected at the Prague Conference.[77] Lenin and Grigory Zinoviev decided to co-opt Stalin to the committee, which Stalin (still in exile in Vologda) agreed to.[77][78] Lenin believed that Stalin, as a Georgian, would help secure support from the empire\'s minority ethnicities.[79] In February 1912, Stalin again escaped to Saint Petersburg,[80] where he was tasked with converting the Bolshevik weekly newspaper, Zvezda (""Star"") into a daily, Pravda (""Truth"").[81] The new newspaper was launched in April 1912 and Stalin\'s role as editor was kept secret.[82] In May 1912, he was again arrested and sentenced to three years of exile in Siberia.[83] In July, he arrived in Narym,[84] where he shared a room with fellow Bolshevik Yakov Sverdlov.[85] After two months, they escaped to Saint Petersburg,[86] where Stalin continued work on Pravda.[87]', 'After the October 1912 Duma elections, Stalin wrote articles calling for reconciliation between the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks; Lenin criticised him[88] and he relented.[89] In January 1913, Stalin travelled to Vienna,[90] where he researched the ""national question"" of how the Bolsheviks should deal with the Empire\'s national and ethnic minorities.[91] His article ""Marxism and the National Question""[92] was first published in the March, April, and May 1913 issues of the Bolshevik journal Prosveshcheniye[93] under the pseudonym ""K. Stalin"". The alias, which he had used since 1912, is derived from the Russian for steel (stal), and has been translated as ""Man of Steel"".[94] In February 1913, Stalin was again arrested in Saint Petersburg[95] and sentenced to four years of exile in Turukhansk in Siberia, where he arrived in August.[96] Still concerned over a potential escape, the authorities moved him to Kureika in March 1914.[97]', ""While Stalin was in exile, Russia entered the First World War, and in October 1916 he and other exiled Bolsheviks were conscripted into the Russian Army.[98] They arrived in Krasnoyarsk in February 1917,[99] where a medical examiner ruled Stalin unfit for service due to his crippled arm.[100] Stalin was required to serve four more months of his exile and successfully requested to serve it in Achinsk.[101] Stalin was in the city when the February Revolution took place; the Tsar abdicated and the Empire became a de facto republic.[102] In a celebratory mood, Stalin travelled by train to Petrograd (as Saint Petersburg had been renamed) in March.[103] He assumed control of Pravda alongside Lev Kamenev,[104] and was appointed as a Bolshevik delegate to the executive committee of the Petrograd Soviet, an influential workers' council.[105]"", 'The existing government of landlords and capitalists must be replaced by a new government, a government of workers and peasants.The existing pseudo-government which was not elected by the people and which is not accountable to the people must be replaced by a government recognised by the people, elected by representatives of the workers, soldiers and peasants and held accountable to their representatives.', ""Stalin helped organise the July Days uprising, an armed display of strength by supporters of the Bolsheviks.[107] After the demonstration was suppressed, the Provisional Government initiated a crackdown on the party, raiding Pravda.[108] Stalin smuggled Lenin out of the paper's office and took charge of his safety, moving him between Petrograd safe houses before smuggling him to nearby Razliv.[109] In Lenin's absence, Stalin continued editing Pravda and served as acting leader of the Bolsheviks, overseeing the party's Sixth Congress.[110] Lenin began calling for the Bolsheviks to seize power by toppling the Provisional Government, a plan which was supported by Stalin and fellow senior Bolshevik Leon Trotsky, but opposed by Kamenev, Zinoviev, and other members.[111]"", ""On 24 October, police raided the Bolshevik newspaper offices, smashing machinery and presses; Stalin salvaged some of the equipment.[112] In the early hours of 25 October, Stalin joined Lenin in a Central Committee meeting in Petrograd's Smolny Institute, from where the Bolshevik coup—the October Revolution—was directed.[113] Bolshevik militia seized Petrograd's power station, main post office, state bank, telephone exchange, and several bridges.[114] A Bolshevik-controlled ship, the Aurora, opened fire on the Winter Palace; the Provisional Government's assembled delegates surrendered and were arrested.[115] Stalin, who had been tasked with briefing the Bolshevik delegates of the Second Congress of Soviets about the situation, had not played a publicly visible role.[116] Trotsky and other later opponents used this as evidence his role had been insignificant, although historians reject this,[117] citing his role as a member of the Central Committee and as an editor of Pravda.[118]"", ""On 26 October 1917, Lenin declared himself chairman of the new government, the Council of People's Commissars (Sovnarkom).[119] Stalin supported Lenin's decision not to form a coalition with the Socialist Revolutionary Party.[120] He became part of an informal leadership group alongside Lenin, Trotsky, and Sverdlov, and his importance within the Bolshevik ranks grew.[121] Stalin's office was near Lenin's in the Smolny Institute,[122] and he and Trotsky had direct access to Lenin without an appointment.[123] Stalin co-signed Lenin's decrees shutting down hostile newspapers,[124] and co-chaired the committee drafting a constitution for the newly-formed Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.[125] He supported Lenin's formation of the Cheka security service and the Red Terror, arguing that state violence was an effective tool for capitalist powers.[126] Unlike some Bolsheviks, Stalin never expressed concern about the Cheka's rapid expansion and the Red Terror.[126]"", ""Having left his role as Pravda editor,[127] Stalin was appointed the People's Commissar for Nationalities.[128] He appointed Nadezhda Alliluyeva as his secretary,[129] and married her in early 1919.[130] In November 1917, he signed the Decree on Nationality, granting ethnic minorities the right to secession and self-determination.[131] He travelled to Helsingfors to meet with the Finnish Social Democrats, and granted Finland's request for independence from Russia in December.[132] Due to the threats posed by the First World War, in March 1918 the government relocated from Petrograd to the Moscow Kremlin.[133] Stalin supported Lenin's desire to sign an armistice with the Central Powers;[134] Stalin thought this necessary because he—unlike Lenin—was unconvinced that Europe was on the verge of proletarian revolution.[135] The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed in March 1918,[136] ceding vast territories and angering many; the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries withdrew from the coalition government.[137] The Bolsheviks were renamed the Russian Communist Party.[138]"", ""In May 1918, during the intensifying Russian Civil War, Sovnarkom sent Stalin to Tsaritsyn to take charge of food procurement in Southern Russia.[139] Eager to prove himself as a commander,[140] he took control of regional military operations and befriended Kliment Voroshilov and Semyon Budyonny, who later formed the core of his military support base.[141] Stalin sent large numbers of Red Army troops to battle the region's White armies, resulting in heavy losses and drawing Lenin's concern.[142] In Tsaritsyn, Stalin commanded the local Cheka branch to execute suspected counter-revolutionaries, often without trial,[143] and purged the military and food collection agencies of middle-class specialists, whom were also executed.[144] His use of state violence was at a greater scale than most Bolshevik leaders approved of,[145] for instance, he ordered several villages torched to ensure compliance with his food procurement program.[146]"", ""In December 1918, Stalin was sent to Perm to lead an inquiry into how Alexander Kolchak's White forces had been able to decimate Red troops there.[147] He returned to Moscow between January and March 1919,[148] before being assigned to the Western Front at Petrograd.[149] When the Red Third Regiment defected, he ordered the public execution of captured defectors.[148] In September he returned to the Southern Front.[148] During the war, Stalin proved his worth to the Central Committee by displaying decisiveness and determination.[140] However, he also disregarded orders and repeatedly threatened to resign when affronted.[150] In November 1919, the government awarded him the Order of the Red Banner for his service.[151]"", ""The Bolsheviks won the main phase of the civil war by the end of 1919.[152] By that time, Sovnarkom had turned its attention to spreading proletarian revolution abroad, forming the Communist International in March 1919; Stalin attended its inaugural ceremony.[153] Although Stalin did not share Lenin's belief that Europe's proletariat were on the verge of revolution, he acknowledged that Soviet Russia remained vulnerable.[154] In February 1920, he was appointed to head the Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate (Rabkrin);[155] that same month he was also transferred to the Caucasian Front.[156]"", 'The Polish–Soviet War broke out in early 1920, with the Poles invading Ukraine,[157] and in May, Stalin was moved to the Southwest Front.[158] Lenin believed that the Polish proletariat would rise up to support an invasion, but Stalin argued that nationalism would lead them to support their government\'s war effort.[159] Stalin lost the argument and accepted Lenin\'s decision.[156] On his front, Stalin became determined to conquer Lvov; in focusing on this goal, he disobeyed orders to transfer his troops to assist Mikhail Tukhachevsky\'s forces at the Battle of Warsaw in early August, which ended in a major defeat for the Red Army.[160] Stalin then returned to Moscow,[161] where Tukhachevsky blamed him for the loss.[162] Humiliated, he demanded demission from the military, which was granted on 1 September.[163] At the 9th Party Congress in late September, Trotsky accused Stalin of ""strategic mistakes""[164] and claimed that he had sabotaged the campaign; Lenin joined in the criticism.[165] Stalin felt disgraced and his antipathy toward Trotsky increased.[166]', 'The Soviet government sought to bring neighbouring states under its domination; in February 1921 it invaded the Menshevik-governed Georgia,[167] and in April 1921, Stalin ordered the Red Army into Turkestan to reassert Soviet control.[168] As People\'s Commissar for Nationalities, Stalin believed that each ethnic group had the right to an ""autonomous republic"" within the Russian state in which it could oversee various regional affairs.[169] In taking this view, some Marxists accused him of bending too much to bourgeois nationalism, while others accused him of remaining too Russo-centric.[170] In his diverse native Caucasus, however, Stalin opposed the idea of separate autonomous republics, arguing that these would oppress ethnic minorities within their territories; instead, he called for a Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic.[171] The Georgian Communist Party opposed the idea, resulting in the Georgian affair.[172] In mid-1921, Stalin returned to the South Caucasus, calling on Georgian communists to reject the chauvinistic nationalism which he argued had marginalised the Abkhazian, Ossetian, and Adjarian minorities.[173] In March 1921, Nadezhda gave birth to another of Stalin\'s sons, Vasily.[174]', ""After the civil war, workers' strikes and peasant uprisings broke out across Russia in opposition to Sovnarkom's food requisitioning project; in response, Lenin introduced market-oriented reforms in the New Economic Policy (NEP).[175] There was also turmoil within the Communist Party, as Trotsky led a faction calling for abolition of trade unions; Lenin opposed this, and Stalin helped rally opposition to Trotsky's position.[176] At the 11th Party Congress in March and April 1922, Lenin nominated Stalin as the party's General Secretary, which was intended as a purely organisational role. Although concerns were expressed that adopting the new position would overstretch his workload and grant him too much power, Stalin was appointed to the post.[177]"", 'Stalin is too crude, and this defect which is entirely acceptable in our milieu and in relationships among us as communists, becomes unacceptable in the position of General Secretary. I therefore propose to comrades that they should devise a means of removing him from this job and should appoint to this job someone else who is distinguished from comrade Stalin in all other respects only by the single superior aspect that he should be more tolerant, more polite and more attentive towards comrades, less capricious, etc.', 'In May 1922, a massive stroke left Lenin partially paralysed.[179] Residing at his Gorki dacha, his main connection to Sovnarkom was through Stalin.[180] Despite their comradeship, Lenin disliked what he referred to as Stalin\'s ""Asiatic"" manner and told his sister Maria that Stalin was ""not intelligent"".[181] The two men argued on the issue of foreign trade; Lenin believed that the Soviet state should have a monopoly on foreign trade, but Stalin supported Grigori Sokolnikov\'s view that doing so was impractical.[182] Another disagreement came over the Georgian affair, with Lenin backing the Georgian Central Committee\'s desire for a Georgian Soviet Republic over Stalin\'s idea of a Transcaucasian one.[183] They also disagreed on the nature of the Soviet state; Lenin called for establishment of a new federation named the ""Union of Soviet Republics of Europe and Asia"",[184] while Stalin believed that this would encourage independence sentiment among non-Russians.[185] Lenin accused Stalin of ""Great Russian chauvinism"", while Stalin accused Lenin of ""national liberalism"".[186] A compromise was reached in which the federation would be named the ""Union of Soviet Socialist Republics"" (USSR), whose formation was ratified in December 1922.[184]', ""Their differences also became personal; Lenin was angered when Stalin was rude to his wife Krupskaya during a telephone conversation.[187] In the final years of his life, Krupskaya provided leading figures with Lenin's Testament, which criticised Stalin's rude manners and excessive power and suggested that he be removed as general secretary.[188] Some historians have questioned whether Lenin wrote the document, suggesting that it was written by Krupskaya;[189] Stalin never publicly voiced concerns about its authenticity.[190] Most historians consider it an accurate reflection of Lenin's views.[191]"", ""Upon Lenin's death in January 1924,[192] Stalin took charge of the funeral and was a pallbearer.[193] To bolster his image as a devoted Leninist amid his growing personality cult, Stalin gave nine lectures at Sverdlov University on the Foundations of Leninism, later published in book form.[194] At the 13th Party Congress in May 1924, Lenin's Testament was read only to the leaders of the provincial delegations.[195] Embarrassed by its contents, Stalin offered his resignation as General Secretary; this act of humility saved him, and he was retained in the post.[196]"", 'As General Secretary, Stalin had a free hand in making appointments to his own staff, and implanted loyalists throughout the party.[197] Favouring new members from proletarian backgrounds to ""Old Bolsheviks"", who tended to be middle-class university graduates,[198] he ensured that he had loyalists dispersed across the regions.[199] Stalin had much contact with young party functionaries,[200] and the desire for promotion led many to seek his favour.[201] Stalin also developed close relations with key figures in the secret police: Felix Dzerzhinsky, Genrikh Yagoda, and Vyacheslav Menzhinsky.[202] His wife gave birth to a daughter, Svetlana, in February 1926.[203]', 'In the wake of Lenin\'s death, a power struggle emerged to become his successor: alongside Stalin was Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Nikolai Bukharin, Alexei Rykov, and Mikhail Tomsky.[204] Stalin saw Trotsky—whom he personally despised[205]—as the main obstacle to his dominance,[206] and during Lenin\'s illness had formed an unofficial triumvirate (troika) with Kamanev and Zinoviev against him.[207] Although Zinoviev was concerned about Stalin\'s growing power, he rallied behind him at the 13th Congress as a counterweight to Trotsky, who now led a faction known as the Left Opposition.[208] Trotsky\'s supporters believed that the NEP conceded too much to capitalism, and they called Stalin a ""rightist"" for his support of the policy.[209] Stalin built up a retinue of his supporters within the Central Committee[210] as the Left Opposition were marginalised.[211]', 'In late 1924, Stalin moved against Kamenev and Zinoviev, removing their supporters from key positions.[212] In 1925, the two moved into open opposition to Stalin and Bukharin[213] and launched an unsuccessful attack on their faction at the 14th Party Congress in December.[214] Stalin accused Kamenev and Zinoviev of reintroducing factionalism, and thus instability.[214] In mid-1926, Kamenev and Zinoviev joined with Trotsky to form the United Opposition against Stalin;[215] in October the two agreed to stop factional activity under threat of expulsion, and later publicly recanted their views.[216] The factionalist arguments continued, with Stalin threatening to resign in October and December 1926, and again in December 1927.[217] In October 1927, Trotsky was removed from the Central Committee;[218] he was later exiled to Kazakhstan in 1928 and deported from the country in 1929.[219]', 'Stalin was now the supreme leader of the party and state.[220] He entrusted the position of head of government to Vyacheslav Molotov; other important supporters on the Politburo were Voroshilov, Lazar Kaganovich, and Sergo Ordzhonikidze,[221] with Stalin ensuring his allies ran state institutions.[222] His growing influence was reflected in naming of locations after him; in June 1924 the Ukrainian city of Yuzovka became Stalino,[223] and in April 1925, Tsaritsyn was renamed Stalingrad.[224] In 1926, Stalin published On Questions of Leninism,[225] in which he argued for the concept of ""socialism in one country"", which was presented as an orthodox Leninist perspective despite clashing with established Bolshevik views that socialism could only be achieved globally through the process of world revolution.[225] In 1927, there was some argument in the party over Soviet policy regarding China. Stalin had called for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), led by Mao Zedong, to ally itself with Chiang Kai-shek\'s Kuomintang (KMT) nationalists, viewing a CCP-KMT alliance as the best bulwark against Japanese imperial expansionism. Instead, the KMT repressed the CCP and a civil war broke out between the two sides.[226]', ""We have fallen behind the advanced countries by fifty to a hundred years. We must close that gap in ten years. Either we do this or we'll be crushed."", 'This is what our obligations before the workers and peasants of the USSR dictate to us.', 'The Soviet Union lagged far behind the industrial and agricultural development of the Western powers.[228] Stalin\'s government feared attack from capitalist countries,[229] and many communists, including in Komsomol, OGPU, and the Red Army, were eager to be rid of the NEP and its market-oriented approach.[230] They had concerns about those who profited from the policy: affluent peasants known as ""kulaks"" and small business owners, or ""NEPmen"".[231] At this point, Stalin turned against the NEP, which put him on a course to the ""left"" even of Trotsky or Zinoviev.[232]', 'In early 1928, Stalin travelled to Novosibirsk, where he alleged that kulaks were hoarding grain and ordered them be arrested and their grain confiscated, with Stalin bringing much of the grain back to Moscow with him in February.[233] At his command, grain procurement squads surfaced across West Siberia and the Urals, with violence breaking out between the squads and the peasantry.[234] Stalin announced that kulaks and the ""middle peasants"" must be coerced into releasing their harvest.[235] Bukharin and other Central Committee members were angered that they had not been consulted about the measure.[236] In January 1930, the Politburo approved the ""liquidation"" of the kulak class, which was exiled to other parts of the country or concentration camps.[237][238] By July 1930, over 320,000 households had been affected.[237] According to Dmitri Volkogonov, de-kulakisation was ""the first mass terror applied by Stalin in his own country.""[239]', 'In 1929, the Politburo announced the mass collectivisation of agriculture,[241] establishing both kolkhoz collective farms and sovkhoz state farms.[242] Although officially voluntary, many peasants joined the collectives out of fear they would face the fate of the kulaks.[243] By 1932, about 62% of households involved in agriculture were part of collectives, and by 1936 this had risen to 90%.[244] Many collectivised peasants resented the loss of their private farmland,[245] and productivity slumped.[246] Famine broke out in many areas,[247] with the Politburo frequently being forced to dispatch emergency food relief.[248] Armed peasant uprisings broke out in Ukraine, the North Caucasus, Southern Russia, and Central Asia, reaching their apex in March 1930; these were suppressed by the army.[249] Stalin responded with an article insisting that collectivisation was voluntary and blaming violence on local officials.[250] Although he and Stalin had been close for many years,[251] Bukharin expressed concerns and regarded them as a return to Lenin\'s old ""war communism"" policy. By mid-1928, he was unable to rally sufficient support in the party to oppose the reforms;[252] in November 1929, Stalin removed him from the Politburo.[253]', 'Officially, the Soviet Union had replaced the ""irrationality"" and ""wastefulness"" of a market economy with a planned economy organised along a long-term and scientific framework; in reality, Soviet economics were based on ad hoc commandments issued often to make short-term targets.[254] In 1928, the first five-year plan was launched by Stalin with a main focus on boosting Soviet heavy industry;[255] it was finished a year ahead of schedule, in 1932.[256] The country underwent a massive economic transformation:[257] new mines were opened, new cities like Magnitogorsk constructed, and work on the White Sea–Baltic Canal began.[257] Millions of peasants moved to the cities, and large debts were accrued purchasing foreign-made machinery.[258]', 'Many major construction projects, including the White Sea–Baltic Canal and the Moscow Metro, were constructed largely through forced labour.[259] The last elements of workers\' control over industry were removed, with factory managers receiving privileges;[260] Stalin defended wage disparity by pointing to Marx\'s argument that it was necessary during the lower stages of socialism.[261] To promote intensification of labour, medals and awards as well as the Stakhanovite movement were introduced.[240] Stalin argued that socialism was being established in the USSR while capitalism was crumbling during the Great Depression.[262] His rhetoric reflected his utopian vision of the ""new Soviet person"" rising to unparallelled heights of human development.[263]', 'In 1928, Stalin declared that class war between the proletariat and their enemies would intensify as socialism developed.[264] He warned of a ""danger from the right"", including from within the Communist Party.[265] The first major show trial in the USSR was the Shakhty Trial of 1928, in which middle-class ""industrial specialists"" were convicted of sabotage.[266] From 1929 to 1930, show trials were held to intimidate opposition;[267] these included the Industrial Party Trial, Menshevik Trial, and Metro-Vickers Trial.[268] Aware that the ethnic Russian majority may have concerns about being ruled by a Georgian,[269] he promoted ethnic Russians throughout the state bureaucracy and made Russian compulsory in schools, albeit in tandem with local languages.[270] Nationalist sentiment was suppressed.[271] Conservative social policies were promoted to boost population growth; this included a focus on strong family units, re-criminalisation of homosexuality, restrictions on abortion and divorce, and abolition of the Zhenotdel women\'s department.[272]', 'Stalin desired a ""cultural revolution"",[273] entailing both the creation of a culture for the ""masses"" and the wider dissemination of previously elite culture.[274] He oversaw a proliferation of schools, newspapers, and libraries, as well as advancement of literacy and numeracy.[275] Socialist realism was promoted throughout the arts,[276] while Stalin wooed prominent writers, namely Maxim Gorky, Mikhail Sholokhov, and Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy.[277] He expressed patronage for scientists whose research fit within his preconceived interpretation of Marxism; for instance, he endorsed the research of agrobiologist Trofim Lysenko despite the fact that it was rejected by the majority of Lysenko\'s scientific peers as pseudo-scientific.[278] The government\'s anti-religious campaign was re-intensified,[279] with increased funding given to the League of Militant Atheists.[271] Priests, imams, and Buddhist monks faced persecution.[267] Religious buildings were demolished, most notably Moscow\'s Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, destroyed in 1931 to make way for the Palace of the Soviets.[280] Religion retained an influence over the population; in the 1937 census, 57% of respondents were willing to admit to being religious.[281]', 'Throughout the 1920s, Stalin placed a priority on foreign policy.[282] He personally met with a range of Western visitors, including George Bernard Shaw and H. G. Wells, both of whom were impressed with him.[283] Through the Communist International, Stalin\'s government exerted a strong influence over Marxist parties elsewhere;[284] he left the running of the organisation to Bukharin before his ousting.[285] At its 6th Congress in July 1928, Stalin informed delegates that the main threat to socialism came from non-Marxist socialists and social democrats, whom he called ""social fascists"";[286] Stalin recognised that in many countries, these groups were Marxist–Leninists\' main rivals for working-class support.[287] This focus on opposing rival leftists concerned Bukharin, who regarded the growth of fascism and the far right across Europe as a greater threat.[285]', 'In 1929, Stalin\'s son Yakov unsuccessfully attempted suicide, shooting himself in the chest and narrowly missing his heart; his failure earned the contempt of Stalin, who is reported to have brushed off the attempt by saying ""He can\'t even shoot straight.""[288][289] His relationship with Nadezhda was strained amid their arguments and her mental health problems.[290] In November 1932, after a group dinner in the Kremlin in which Stalin flirted with other women, Nadezhda shot herself in the heart.[291] Publicly, the cause of death was given as appendicitis; Stalin also concealed the real cause of death from his children.[292] Stalin\'s friends noted that he underwent a significant change following her suicide, becoming emotionally harder.[293]', ""Within the Soviet Union, civic disgruntlement against Stalin's government was widespread.[294] Social unrest in urban areas led Stalin to ease some economic policies in 1932.[295] In May 1932, he introduced kolkhoz markets where peasants could trade surplus produce.[296] However, penal sanctions became harsher; a decree in August 1932 made the theft of a handful of grain a capital offence.[297] The second five-year plan reduced production quotas from the first, focusing more on improving living conditions[295] through housing and consumer goods.[295] Emphasis on armament production increased after Adolf Hitler became German chancellor in 1933.[298]"", ""The Soviet Union experienced a major famine which peaked in the winter of 1932–1933,[299] with 5–7 million deaths.[300] The worst affected areas were Ukraine (where the famine was called the Holodomor), Southern Russia, Kazakhstan and the North Caucasus.[301] In the case of Ukraine, historians debate whether the famine was intentional, with the purpose of eliminating a potential independence movement;[302] no documents show Stalin explicitly ordered starvation.[303] Poor weather led to bad harvests in 1931 and 1932,[304] compounded by years of declining productivity.[300] Rapid industrialisation policies, neglect of crop rotation, and failure to build reserve grain stocks exacerbated the crisis.[305] Stalin blamed hostile elements and saboteurs among the peasants.[306] The government provided limited food aid to famine-stricken areas, prioritising urban workers;[307] for Stalin, Soviet industrialisation was more valuable than peasant lives.[308] Grain exports declined heavily.[309] Stalin did not acknowledge his policies' role in the famine,[297] which was concealed from foreign observers.[310]"", 'In 1936, Stalin oversaw the adoption of a new constitution with expansive democratic features; it was designed as propaganda, as all power rested in his hands.[311] He declared that ""socialism, the first phase of communism, has been achieved"".[311] In 1938, the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) was released;[312] commonly known as the ""Short Course"", it became the central text of Stalinism.[313] Authorised Stalin biographies were also published,[314] though Stalin preferred to be viewed as the embodiment of the Communist Party, rather than have his life story explored.[315]', ""Seeking better international relations, in 1934 the Soviet Union joined the League of Nations, from which it had previously been excluded.[316] Stalin initiated confidential communications with Hitler in October 1933, shortly after the latter came to power.[317] Stalin admired Hitler, particularly his manoeuvres to remove rivals within the Nazi Party in the Night of the Long Knives.[318] Stalin nevertheless recognised the threat posed by fascism and sought to establish better links with the liberal democracies of Western Europe;[319] in May 1935, the Soviets signed treaties of mutual assistance with France and Czechoslovakia.[320] At the Communist International's 7th Congress in July–August 1935, the Soviet Union encouraged Marxist–Leninists to unite with other leftists as part of a popular front against fascism.[321] In response, Germany, Italy, and Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact.[322]"", 'When the Spanish Civil War broke out in July 1936, the Soviets sent military aid to the Republican faction, including 648 aircraft and 407 tanks, along with 3,000 Soviet troops and 42,000 members of the International Brigades.[323] Stalin took a personal involvement in the Spanish situation.[324] Germany and Italy backed the Nationalist faction, which was ultimately victorious in March 1939.[325] With the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in July 1937, the Soviet Union and China signed a non-aggression pact.[326] Stalin aided the Chinese as the KMT and the Communists suspended their civil war and formed his desired United Front against Japan.[327]', ""Stalin's approach to state repression was often contradictory.[328] In May 1933, he released many convicted of minor offences, ordering the security services not to enact further mass arrests and deportations,[329] and in September 1934, he launched a commission to investigate false imprisonments. That same month, he called for the execution of workers at the Stalin Metallurgical Factory accused of spying for Japan.[328][329] After Sergei Kirov was murdered in December 1934, Stalin became increasingly concerned about assassination threats,[330] and state repression intensified.[331] Stalin issued a decree establishing NKVD troikas which could issue rapid and severe sentences without involving the courts.[332] In 1935, he ordered the NKVD to expel suspected counterrevolutionaries from urban areas;[298] over 11,000 were expelled from Leningrad alone in early 1935.[298]"", ""In 1936, Nikolai Yezhov became head of the NKVD,[333] after which Stalin move to orchestrate the arrest and execution of his remaining opponents in the Communist Party in the Great Purge.[334] The first Moscow Trial in August 1936 saw Kamenev and Zinoviev executed.[335] The second trial took place in January 1937,[336] and the third in March 1938, with Bukharin and Rykov executed.[337] By late 1937, all remnants of collective leadership were gone from the Politburo, which was now effectively under Stalin's control.[338] There were mass expulsions from the party,[339] with Stalin also ordering foreign communist parties to purge anti-Stalinist elements.[340] These purges replaced most of the party's old guard with younger officials loyal to Stalin.[341] Party functionaries readily carried out their commands and sought to ingratiate themselves with Stalin, to avoid becoming victims.[342] Such functionaries often carried out more arrests and executions than their quotas set by government.[343]"", 'Repressions intensified further from December 1936 until November 1938.[345] In May 1937, Stalin ordered the arrest of much of the army\'s high command, and mass arrests in the military followed.[346] By late 1937, purges extended beyond the party to the wider population.[347] In July 1937, the Politburo ordered a purge of ""anti-Soviet elements"", targeting anti-Stalin Bolsheviks, former Mensheviks, Socialist Revolutionaries, priests, ex–White Army soldiers, and common criminals.[348] Stalin initiated ""national operations"", the ethnic cleansing of non-Soviet ethnic groups — among them Poles, Germans, Latvians, Finns, Greeks, Koreans, and Chinese — through internal or external exile.[349] More than 1.6 million people were arrested, 700,000 shot, and an unknown number died under torture.[350] The NKVD also assassinated defectors and opponents abroad;[351] in August 1940, Trotsky was assassinated in Mexico, eliminating Stalin\'s last major opponent.[352]', 'Stalin initiated all key decisions during the purge, and personally directed many operations.[353] Historians debate his motives,[350] noting his personal writings from the period were ""unusually convoluted and incoherent"", filled with claims about enemies encircling him.[354] He feared a domestic fifth column in the event of war with Japan and Germany,[355] particularly after right-wing forces overthrew the leftist Spanish government.[356] The Great Purge ended when Yezhov was replaced by Lavrentiy Beria,[357] a fellow Georgian completely loyal to Stalin.[358] Yezhov himself was arrested in April 1939 and executed in 1940.[359] The purge damaged the Soviet Union\'s reputation abroad, particularly among leftist sympathisers.[360] As it wound down, Stalin sought to deflect his responsibility,[361] blaming its ""excesses"" and ""violations of law"" on Yezhov.[362]', 'As a Marxist–Leninist, Stalin considered conflict between competing capitalist powers inevitable; after Nazi Germany annexed Austria and then part of Czechoslovakia in 1938, he recognised a major war was looming.[363] He sought to maintain Soviet neutrality, hoping that a German war against France and the United Kingdom would lead to Soviet dominance in Europe.[364] The Soviets faced a threat from the east, with Soviet troops clashing with the expansionist Japanese in the latter part of the 1930s, culminating in the Battles of Khalkhin Gol in 1939.[365] Stalin initiated a military build-up, with the Red Army more than doubling between January 1939 and June 1941, although in haste many of its officers were poorly trained.[366] Between 1940 and 1941 Stalin purged the military, leaving it with a severe shortage of trained officers when war eventually broke out.[367]', ""As Britain and France seemed unwilling to commit to an alliance with the Soviet Union, Stalin saw a better deal with the Germans.[368] On 3 May 1939, he replaced his Western-oriented foreign minister Maxim Litvinov with Vyacheslav Molotov.[369] Germany began negotiations with the Soviets, proposing that Eastern Europe be divided between the two powers.[370] In August 1939, the Soviet Union signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact with Germany, a non-aggression pact negotiated by Molotov and German foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop with a secret protocol dividing Eastern Europe.[371] On 1 September, Germany invaded Poland, leading the UK and France to declare war on Germany.[372] On 17 September, the Red Army entered eastern Poland, officially to restore order.[373] On 28 September, Germany and the Soviet Union exchanged some of their conquered territories,[374] and a German–Soviet Frontier Treaty was signed shortly after in Stalin's presence.[375] The two states continued trading, undermining the British blockade of Germany.[376]"", 'The Soviets further demanded parts of eastern Finland, but the Finnish government refused. The Soviets invaded Finland in November 1939, starting the Winter War; despite numerical inferiority, the Finns kept the Red Army at bay.[377] International opinion backed Finland, with the Soviet Union being expelled from the League of Nations.[378] Embarrassed by their inability to defeat the Finns, the Soviets signed an interim peace treaty, in which they received territorial concessions.[379] In June 1940, the Red Army occupied the Baltic states, which were forcibly merged into the Soviet Union in August;[380] they also invaded and annexed Bessarabia and northern Bukovina, parts of Romania.[381] The Soviets sought to forestall dissent in the new territories with mass repressions.[382] A noted instance was the Katyn massacre of April and May 1940, in which around 22,000 members of the Polish armed forces, police, and intelligentsia were executed by the NKVD.[383]', ""The speed of the German victory over and occupation of France in mid-1940 took Stalin by surprise.[384] He seemingly focused on appeasement inorder to delay conflict.[385] After the Tripartite Pact was signed by the Axis Powers of Germany, Japan, and Italy in October 1940, Stalin proposed that the USSR also join the Axis alliance.[386] To demonstrate peaceful intentions, in April 1941 the Soviets signed a neutrality pact with Japan.[387] Stalin, who had been the country's de facto head of government for almost 15 years, concluded that relations with Germany had deteriorated to such an extent that he needed to become de jure head of government as well, and on 6 May, replaced Molotov as Premier of the Soviet Union.[388]"", ""In June 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union, initiating the war on the Eastern Front.[389] Despite intelligence agencies repeatedly warning him of Germany's intentions, Stalin was taken by surprise.[390] He formed a State Defence Committee, which he headed as Supreme Commander,[391] as well as a military Supreme Command (Stavka),[392] with Georgy Zhukov as its Chief of Staff.[393] The German tactic of blitzkrieg was initially highly effective; the Soviet air force in the western borderlands was destroyed within two days.[394] The German Wehrmacht pushed deep into Soviet territory;[395] soon, Ukraine, Byelorussia, and the Baltic states were under German occupation, and Leningrad was under siege;[396] and Soviet refugees were flooding into Moscow and surrounding cities.[397] By July, Germany's Luftwaffe was bombing Moscow,[396] and by October the Wehrmacht was amassing for a full assault on the capital. Plans were made for the Soviet government to evacuate to Kuibyshev, although Stalin decided to remain in Moscow, believing his flight would damage troop morale.[398] The German advance on Moscow was halted after two months of battle in increasingly harsh weather conditions.[399]"", 'Going against the advice of Zhukov and other generals, Stalin emphasised attack over defence.[400] In June 1941, he ordered a scorched earth policy of destroying infrastructure and food supplies before the Germans could seize them,[401] also commanding the NKVD to kill around 100,000 political prisoners in areas the Wehrmacht approached.[402] He purged the military command; several high-ranking figures were demoted or reassigned and others were arrested and executed.[403] With Order No. 270, Stalin commanded soldiers risking capture to fight to the death, describing the captured as traitors;[404] among those taken as a prisoner of war was Stalin\'s son Yakov, who died in German custody.[405] Stalin issued Order No. 227 in July 1942, which directed that those retreating unauthorised would be placed in ""penal battalions"" and used as cannon fodder.[406] Both the German and Soviet armies disregarded the laws of war in the Geneva Conventions;[407] the Soviets heavily publicised Nazi massacres of communists, Jews, and Romani.[408] In April 1942, Stalin sponsored the formation of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee (JAC) to garner global Jewish support for the war effort.[409]', 'The Soviets allied with the UK and U.S.;[410] although the U.S. joined the war against Germany in 1941, little direct American assistance reached the Soviets until late 1942.[407] Responding to the invasion, the Soviets expanded their industry in central Russia, focusing almost entirely on military production.[411] They achieved high levels of productivity, outstripping Germany.[408] During the war, Stalin was more tolerant of the Russian Orthodox Church and allowed it to resume some of its activities.[412] He also permitted a wider range of cultural expression, notably permitting formerly suppressed writers and artists like Anna Akhmatova and Dmitri Shostakovich to disperse their work more widely.[413] ""The Internationale"" was dropped as the country\'s national anthem, to be replaced with a more patriotic song.[414] The government increasingly promoted Pan-Slavist sentiment,[415] while encouraging increased criticism of cosmopolitanism, particularly ""rootless cosmopolitanism"", an approach with particular repercussions for Soviet Jews.[416] The Communist International was dissolved in 1943,[417] and Stalin began encouraging foreign Marxist–Leninist parties to emphasise nationalism over internationalism in order to broaden their domestic appeal.[415]', ""In April 1942, Stalin overrode Stavka by ordering the Soviets' first serious counter-attack, an attempt to seize German-held Kharkov in eastern Ukraine. This attack proved unsuccessful.[418] That year, Hitler shifted his primary goal from an overall victory on the Eastern Front to the goal of securing the oil fields in the southern Soviet Union crucial to a long-term German war effort.[419] While Red Army generals saw evidence that Hitler would shift efforts south, Stalin considered this to be a flanking move in a renewed effort to take Moscow.[420] In June 1942, the German Army began a major offensive in Southern Russia, threatening Stalingrad; Stalin ordered the Red Army to hold the city at all costs,[421] resulting in the protracted Battle of Stalingrad, which became the bloodiest and fiercest battle of the entire war.[422] In February 1943, the German forces attacking Stalingrad surrendered.[423] The Soviet victory there marked a major turning point in the war;[424] in commemoration, Stalin declared himself Marshal of the Soviet Union in March.[425]"", 'By November 1942, the Soviets had begun to repulse the German southern campaign and, although there were 2.5\xa0million Soviet casualties in that effort, it permitted the Soviets to take the offensive for most of the rest of the war on the Eastern Front.[426] In summer 1943, Germany attempted an encirclement attack at Kursk, which was successfully repulsed by the Soviets.[427] By the end of the year, the Soviets occupied half of the territory taken by the Germans to that point.[428] Soviet military industrial output also had increased substantially from late 1941 to early 1943 after Stalin had moved factories well to the east of the front, safe from invasion and aerial assault.[429]', 'In Allied countries, Stalin was increasingly depicted in a positive light over the course of the war.[430] In 1941, the London Philharmonic Orchestra performed a concert to celebrate his birthday,[431] and in 1942, Time magazine named him ""Man of the Year"".[430] When Stalin learnt that people in Western countries affectionately called him ""Uncle Joe"" he was initially offended, regarding it as undignified.[432] There remained mutual suspicions between Stalin, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, together known as the ""Big Three"".[433] Churchill flew to Moscow to visit Stalin in August 1942 and again in October 1944.[434] Stalin scarcely left Moscow during the war,[435] frustrating Roosevelt and Churchill with his reluctance to meet them.[436]', ""In November 1943, Stalin met with Churchill and Roosevelt in Tehran, a location of Stalin's choosing.[437] There, Stalin and Roosevelt got on well, with both desiring the post-war dismantling of the British Empire.[438] At Tehran, the trio agreed that to prevent Germany rising to military prowess yet again, the German state should be broken up.[439] Roosevelt and Churchill also agreed to Stalin's demand that the German city of Königsberg be declared Soviet territory.[439] Stalin was impatient for the UK and U.S. to open up a Western Front to take the pressure off of the East; they eventually did so in mid-1944.[440] Stalin insisted that, after the war, the Soviet Union should incorporate the portions of Poland it had occupied in 1939, which Churchill opposed.[441] Discussing the fate of the Balkans, later in 1944 Churchill agreed to Stalin's suggestion that after the war, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Yugoslavia would come under the Soviet sphere of influence while Greece would come under that of the Western powers.[442]"", ""In 1944, the Soviet Union made significant advances across Eastern Europe toward Germany,[443] including Operation Bagration, a massive offensive in the Byelorussian SSR against the German Army Group Centre.[444] In 1944, the German armies were pushed out of the Baltic states, which were then re-annexed into the Soviet Union.[445] As the Red Army reconquered the Caucasus and Crimea, various ethnic groups living in the region—the Kalmyks, Chechens, Ingushi, Karachai, Balkars, and Crimean Tatars—were accused of having collaborated with the Germans. Using the idea of collective responsibility as a basis, Stalin's government abolished their autonomous republics and between late 1943 and 1944 deported the majority of their populations to Central Asia and Siberia.[446] Over one million people were deported as a result of the policy, with high rates of mortality.[447]"", ""In February 1945, the three leaders met at the Yalta Conference.[448] Roosevelt and Churchill conceded to Stalin's demand that Germany pay the Soviet Union 20\xa0billion dollars in reparations, and that his country be permitted to annex Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands in exchange for entering the war against Japan.[449] An agreement was also made that a post-war Polish government should be a coalition consisting of both communist and conservative elements.[450] Privately, Stalin sought to ensure that Poland would come fully under Soviet influence.[451] The Red Army withheld assistance to Polish resistance fighters battling the Germans in the Warsaw Uprising, with Stalin believing that any victorious Polish militants could interfere with his future aspirations to dominate Poland.[452] Stalin placed great emphasis on capturing Berlin before the Western Allies, believing that this would enable him to bring more of Europe under long-term Soviet control. Churchill, concerned by this, unsuccessfully tried to convince the U.S. that they should pursue the same goal.[453]"", ""In April 1945, the Red Army seized Berlin, Hitler killed himself, and Germany surrendered in May.[454] Stalin had wanted Hitler captured alive; he had his remains brought to Moscow in order to prevent them becoming a relic for Nazi sympathisers.[455] Many Soviet soldiers engaged in looting, pillaging, and rape, both in Germany and parts of Eastern Europe.[456] Stalin refused to punish the offenders.[453] With Germany defeated, Stalin switched focus to the war with Japan, transferring half a million troops to the Far East.[457] Stalin was pressed by his allies to enter the war and wanted to cement the Soviet Union's strategic position in Asia.[458] On 8 August, in between the U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Soviet army invaded Japanese-occupied Manchuria and northern Korea, defeating the Kwantung Army.[459] These events led to the Japanese surrender and the war's end.[460] The U.S. rebuffed Stalin's desire for the Red Army to take a role in the Allied occupation of Japan.[461]"", 'At the Potsdam Conference in July–August 1945, Stalin repeated previous promises that he would refrain from a ""Sovietisation"" of Eastern Europe.[462] Stalin pushed for reparations from Germany without regard to the base minimum supply for German citizens\' survival, which worried Harry Truman and Churchill, who thought that Germany would become a financial burden for the Western powers.[463] Stalin also pushed for ""war booty"", which would permit the Soviet Union to directly seize property from conquered nations without quantitative or qualitative limitation, and a clause was added permitting this to occur with some limitations.[463] Germany was divided into four zones: Soviet, U.S., British, and French, with Berlin—located in the Soviet area—also divided thusly.[464]', 'After the war, Stalin was at the apex of his career.[465] Within the Soviet Union he was widely regarded as the embodiment of victory and patriotism,[466] and his armies controlled Central and Eastern Europe up to the River Elbe.[465] In June 1945, Stalin adopted the title of Generalissimo[467] and stood atop Lenin\'s Mausoleum to watch a celebratory parade led by Zhukov through Red Square.[468] At a banquet held for army commanders, he described the Russian people as ""the outstanding nation"" and ""leading force"" within the Soviet Union, the first time that he had unequivocally endorsed Russians over the other Soviet nationalities.[469] In 1946, the state published Stalin\'s Collected Works.[470] In 1947, it brought out a second edition of his official biography, which glorified him to a greater extent than its predecessor.[471] He was quoted in Pravda on a daily basis and pictures of him remained pervasive on the walls of workplaces and homes.[472]', 'Despite his strengthened international position, Stalin was cautious about internal dissent and desire for change among the population.[473] He was also concerned about his returning armies, who had been exposed to a wide range of consumer goods in Germany, much of which they had looted and brought back with them. In this he recalled the 1825 Decembrist Revolt by Russian soldiers returning from having defeated France in the Napoleonic Wars.[474] He ensured that returning Soviet prisoners of war went through ""filtration"" camps as they arrived in the Soviet Union, in which 2,775,700 were interrogated to determine if they were traitors. About half were then imprisoned in labour camps.[475] In the Baltic states, where there was much opposition to Soviet rule, de-kulakisation and de-clericalisation programmes were initiated, resulting in 142,000 deportations between 1945 and 1949.[445] The Gulag system of forced labour camps was expanded further. By January 1953, three percent of the Soviet population was imprisoned or in internal exile, with 2.8\xa0million in ""special settlements"" in isolated areas and another 2.5\xa0million in camps, penal colonies, and prisons.[476]', ""The NKVD were ordered to catalogue the scale of destruction during the war.[477] It was established that 1,710 Soviet towns and 70,000 villages had been destroyed.[478] The NKVD recorded that between 26 and 27 million Soviet citizens had been killed, with millions more being wounded, malnourished, or orphaned.[479] In the war's aftermath, some of Stalin's associates suggested modifications to government policy.[480] Post-war Soviet society was more tolerant than its pre-war phase in various respects. Stalin allowed the Russian Orthodox Church to retain the churches it had opened during the war,[481] and academia and the arts were also allowed greater freedom.[482] Recognising the need for drastic steps to be taken to combat inflation and promote economic recovery, in December 1947 Stalin's government devalued the rouble and abolished the food rationing system.[483] Capital punishment was abolished in 1947 but re-instituted in 1950.[484] Stalin's health deteriorated,[485] and he grew increasingly concerned that senior figures might try to oust him.[486] He demoted Molotov,[487] and increasingly favoured Beria and Malenkov for key positions.[488] In the Leningrad affair, the city's leadership was purged amid accusations of treachery; executions of many of the accused took place in 1950.[489]"", ""In the post-war period there were often food shortages in Soviet cities,[490] and the USSR experienced a major famine from 1946 to 1947.[491] Sparked by a drought and ensuing bad harvest in 1946, it was exacerbated by government policy towards food procurement, including the state's decision to build up stocks and export food rather than distributing it to famine-hit areas.[492] Estimates indicate that between one million and 1.5\xa0million people died from malnutrition or disease as a result.[493] While agricultural production stagnated, Stalin focused on a series of major infrastructure projects, including the construction of hydroelectric plants, canals, and railway lines running to the polar north.[494] Many of these were constructed through prison labour.[494]"", 'In the aftermath of the war, the British Empire declined, leaving the U.S. and USSR as the dominant world powers.[495] Tensions among these former Allies grew,[466] resulting in the Cold War.[496] Although Stalin publicly described the British and U.S. governments as aggressive, he thought it unlikely that a war with them would be imminent, believing that several decades of peace was likely.[497] He nevertheless secretly intensified Soviet research into nuclear weaponry, intent on creating an atom bomb.[465] Still, Stalin foresaw the undesirability of a nuclear conflict, stating that ""atomic weapons can hardly be used without spelling the end of the world.""[498] He personally took a keen interest in the development of the weapon.[499] In August 1949, the bomb was successfully tested in the deserts outside Semipalatinsk in Kazakhstan.[500] Stalin also initiated a new military build-up; the Soviet army was expanded from 2.9\xa0million soldiers, as it stood in 1949, to 5.8\xa0million by 1953.[501]', 'The U.S. began pushing its interests on every continent, acquiring air force bases in Africa and Asia and ensuring pro-U.S. regimes took power across Latin America.[502] It launched the Marshall Plan in June 1947, with which it sought to undermine Soviet hegemony throughout Eastern Europe. The U.S. offered financial assistance to countries on the condition that they opened their markets to trade, aware that the Soviets would never agree.[503] The Allies demanded that Stalin withdraw the Red Army from northern Iran. He initially refused, leading to an international crisis in 1946, but relented one year later.[504] Stalin also tried to maximise Soviet influence on the world stage, unsuccessfully pushing for Libya—recently liberated from Italian occupation—to become a Soviet protectorate.[505][506] He sent Molotov as his representative to San Francisco to take part in negotiations to form the United Nations, insisting that the Soviets have a place on its Security Council.[496] In April 1949, the Western powers established the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), an anti-Soviet military alliance led by the U.S.[507] In the West, Stalin was increasingly portrayed as the ""most evil dictator alive"" and compared to Hitler.[508]', ""In 1948, Stalin edited and rewrote sections of Falsifiers of History, published as a series of Pravda articles in February 1948 and then in book form. Written in response to public revelations of the 1939 Soviet alliance with Germany, it focused on blaming the Western powers for the war.[509] He also erroneously claimed that the initial German advance in the early part of the war, during Operation Barbarossa, was not a result of Soviet military weakness, but rather a deliberate Soviet strategic retreat.[510] In 1949, celebrations took place to mark Stalin's 70th birthday (although he actually was turning 71 at the time) at which Stalin attended an event at the Bolshoi Theatre alongside Marxist–Leninist leaders from across Europe and Asia.[511]"", 'After the war, Stalin sought to retain Soviet dominance across Eastern Europe while expanding its influence in Asia.[445] Cautiously regarding the responses from the Western Allies, Stalin avoided immediately installing Communist Party governments in Eastern Europe, instead initially ensuring that Marxist-Leninists were placed in coalition ministries.[506] In contrast to his approach to the Baltic states, he rejected the proposal of merging the new communist states into the Soviet Union, rather recognising them as independent nation-states.[512] He was faced with the problem that there were few Marxists left in Eastern Europe, with most having been killed by the Nazis.[513] He demanded that war reparations be paid by Germany and its Axis allies Hungary, Romania, and the Slovak Republic.[466] Aware that the countries of Eastern Europe had been pushed to socialism through invasion rather than revolution, Stalin called them  ""people\'s democracies"" instead of ""dictatorships of the proletariat"".[514]', 'Churchill observed that an ""Iron Curtain"" had been drawn across Europe, separating the east from the west.[515] In September 1947, a meeting of East European communist leaders established Cominform to co-ordinate the Communist Parties across Eastern Europe and also in France and Italy.[516] Stalin did not personally attend the meeting, sending Andrei Zhdanov in his place.[464] Various East European communists also visited Stalin in Moscow.[517] There, he offered advice on their ideas; for instance, he cautioned against the Yugoslav idea for a Balkan Federation incorporating Bulgaria and Albania.[517] Stalin had a particularly strained relationship with Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito due to the latter\'s continued calls for a Balkan federation and for Soviet aid for the communist forces in the ongoing Greek Civil War.[518] In March 1948, Stalin launched an anti-Tito campaign, accusing the Yugoslav communists of adventurism and deviating from Marxist–Leninist doctrine.[519] At the second Cominform conference, held in Bucharest in June 1948, East European communist leaders all denounced Tito\'s government, accusing them of being fascists and agents of Western capitalism.[520] Stalin ordered several assassination attempts on Tito\'s life and even contemplated an invasion of Yugoslavia itself.[521]', ""Stalin suggested that a unified, but demilitarised, German state be established, hoping that it would either come under Soviet influence or remain neutral.[522] When the U.S. and UK opposed this, Stalin sought to force their hand by blockading Berlin in June 1948.[523] He gambled that the Western powers would not risk war, but they airlifted supplies into West Berlin until May 1949, when Stalin relented and ended the blockade.[507] In September 1949 the Western powers transformed their zones into an independent Federal Republic of Germany; in response the Soviets formed theirs into the German Democratic Republic in October.[522] In accordance with earlier agreements, the Western powers expected Poland to become an independent state with free democratic elections.[524] In Poland, the Soviets merged various socialist parties into the Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR), and vote rigging was used to ensure that the PZPR secured office.[519] The 1947 Hungarian elections were also rigged by Stalin, with the Hungarian Working People's Party taking control.[519] In Czechoslovakia, where the communists did have a level of popular support, they were elected the largest party in 1946.[525] Monarchy was abolished in Bulgaria and Romania.[526] Across Eastern Europe, the Soviet model was enforced, with a termination of political pluralism, agricultural collectivisation, and investment in heavy industry.[520] It was aimed at establishing economic autarky within the Eastern Bloc.[520]"", ""In October 1949, Chinese Communist Party chairman Mao Zedong took power in China and proclaimed the People's Republic of China.[527] Marxist governments now controlled a third of the world's land mass.[528] Privately, Stalin revealed that he had underestimated the Chinese Communists and their ability to win the civil war, instead encouraging them to make another peace with the KMT.[529] In December 1949, Mao visited Stalin. Initially Stalin refused to repeal the Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1945, which significantly benefited the Soviet Union over China, although in January 1950 he relented and agreed to sign a new treaty.[530] Stalin was concerned that Mao might follow Tito's example by pursuing a course independent of Soviet influence, and made it known that if displeased he would withdraw assistance; the Chinese desperately needed said assistance after decades of civil war.[531]"", ""At the end of World War II, the Soviet Union and the United States divided up the Korean Peninsula, formerly a Japanese colonial possession, along the 38th parallel, setting up a communist government in the north and a pro-Western, anti-communist government in the south.[532] North Korean leader Kim Il Sung visited Stalin in March 1949 and again in March 1950; he wanted to invade the south, and although Stalin was initially reluctant to provide support, he eventually agreed by May 1950.[533] The North Korean Army launched the Korean War by invading South Korea in June 1950, making swift gains and capturing Seoul.[534] Both Stalin and Mao believed that a swift victory would ensue.[534] The U.S. went to the UN Security Council—which the Soviets were boycotting over its refusal to recognise Mao's government—and secured international military support for the South Koreans. U.S. led forces pushed the North Koreans back.[535] Stalin wanted to avoid direct Soviet conflict with the U.S., and convinced the Chinese to enter the war to aid the North in October 1950.[536]"", 'The Soviet Union was one of the first nations to extend diplomatic recognition to the newly created state of Israel in 1948, in hopes of obtaining an ally in the Middle East.[537] When the Israeli ambassador Golda Meir arrived in the USSR, Stalin was angered by the Jewish crowds who gathered to greet her.[538] He was further angered by Israel\'s growing alliance with the U.S.[539] After Stalin fell out with Israel, he launched an anti-Jewish campaign within the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc.[514] In November 1948, he abolished the JAC,[540] and show trials took place for some of its members.[541] The Soviet press engaged in vituperative attacks on Zionism, Jewish culture, and ""rootless cosmopolitanism"",[542] with growing levels of antisemitism being expressed across Soviet society.[543] Stalin\'s increasing tolerance of antisemitism may have stemmed from his increasing Russian nationalism or from the recognition that antisemitism had proved a useful tool for Hitler;[544] he may have increasingly viewed the Jewish people as a ""counter-revolutionary"" nation.[545] There were rumours that Stalin was planning on deporting all Soviet Jews to the Jewish Autonomous Region in Birobidzhan in Siberia.[546]', ""In his later years, Stalin was in poor health.[547] He took increasingly long holidays; in 1950 and again in 1951 he spent almost five months on holiday at his Abkhazian dacha.[548] Stalin nevertheless mistrusted his doctors; in January 1952 he had one imprisoned after they suggested that he should retire to improve his health.[547] In September 1952, several Kremlin doctors were arrested for allegedly plotting to kill senior politicians in what came to be known as the doctors' plot; the majority of the accused were Jewish.[549] Stalin ordered that the doctors be tortured to ensure confessions.[550] In November, the Slánský trial took place in Czechoslovakia, in which 13 senior Communist Party figures, 11 of them Jewish, were accused and convicted of being part of a vast Zionist-American conspiracy to subvert the Eastern Bloc.[551] The same month, a much publicised trial of accused Jewish industrial wreckers took place in Ukraine.[552] In 1951, Stalin initiated the Mingrelian affair, a purge of the Georgian Communist Party which resulted in over 11,000 deportations.[553]"", 'From 1946 until his death, Stalin only gave three public speeches, two of which lasted only a few minutes.[554] The amount of written material that he produced also declined.[554] In 1950, Stalin issued the article ""Marxism and Problems of Linguistics"", which reflected his interest in questions of Russian nationhood.[555] In 1952, Stalin\'s last book, Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR, was published. It sought to provide a guide to leading the country after his death.[556] In October 1952, he gave an hour and a half speech at the Central Committee plenum.[557] There, he emphasised what he regarded as necessary leadership qualities, and highlighted the weaknesses of potential successors, notably Molotov and Mikoyan.[558] In 1952, he eliminated the Politburo and replaced it with a larger version he named the Presidium.[559]', ""On 1 March 1953, Stalin's staff found him semi-conscious on the bedroom floor of his Kuntsevo Dacha.[560] He was moved onto a couch and remained there for three days,[561] during which he was hand-fed using a spoon and given various medicines and injections.[562] Stalin's condition continued to deteriorate, and he died on 5 March.[563] An autopsy revealed that he had died of a cerebral haemorrhage, and that his cerebral arteries had been severely damaged by atherosclerosis.[564] Stalin's death was announced on 6 March;[565] his body was embalmed,[566] and then displayed in Moscow's House of Unions for three days.[567] The crowds coming to view the body were so large and disorganised that many people were killed in a crowd crush.[568] At the funeral on 9 March, attended by hundreds of thousands, Stalin was laid to rest in Lenin's Mausoleum in Red Square.[569]"", ""Stalin left neither a designated successor nor a framework within which a peaceful transfer of power could take place.[570] The Central Committee met on the day of his death, after which Malenkov, Beria, and Khrushchev emerged as the party's dominant figures.[571] The system of collective leadership was restored, and measures introduced to prevent any one member from attaining autocratic domination.[572] The collective leadership included Georgy Malenkov, Lavrentiy Beria, Vyacheslav Molotov, Kliment Voroshilov, Nikita Khrushchev, Nikolai Bulganin, Lazar Kaganovich and Anastas Mikoyan.[573] Reforms to the Soviet system were immediately implemented.[574] Economic reform scaled back mass construction projects, placed a new emphasis on house building, and eased the levels of taxation on the peasantry to stimulate production.[575] The new leaders sought rapprochement with Yugoslavia and a less hostile relationship with the U.S.,[576] and they pursued a negotiated end to the Korean War in July 1953.[577][578] The imprisoned doctors were released and the antisemitic purges ceased.[579] A mass amnesty for certain convicts was issued, halving the country's inmate population, and the state security and Gulag systems were reformed.[575]"", 'Stalin claimed to have embraced Marxism at the age of 15,[580] and it served as the guiding philosophy throughout his adult life;[581] according to Kotkin, Stalin held ""zealous Marxist convictions"",[582] while Montefiore suggested that Marxism held a ""quasi-religious"" value for Stalin.[583] Although he never became a Georgian nationalist,[584] during his early life elements from Georgian nationalist thought blended with Marxism in his outlook.[585] Stalin believed in the need to adapt Marxism to changing circumstances; in 1917, he declared that ""there is dogmatic Marxism and there is creative Marxism. I stand on the ground of the latter"".[586] According to scholar Robert Service, Stalin\'s ""few innovations in ideology were crude, dubious developments of Marxism"".[581]', 'Stalin believed in an inevitable ""class war"" between the world\'s proletariat and bourgeoisie[587] in which the working classes would prove victorious and establish a dictatorship of the proletariat,[588] regarding the Soviet Union as an example of such a state.[589] He also believed that this proletarian state would need to introduce repressive measures against foreign and domestic ""enemies"" to ensure the full crushing of the propertied classes,[590] and thus the class war would intensify with the advance of socialism.[591] As a propaganda tool, the shaming of ""enemies"" explained all inadequate economic and political outcomes, the hardships endured by the populace, and military failures.[592]', 'Stalin adhered to the Leninist variant of Marxism.[593] In his book, Foundations of Leninism, he stated that ""Leninism is the Marxism of the epoch of imperialism and of the proletarian revolution"".[594] He claimed to be a loyal Leninist,[595] although was—according to Service—""not a blindly obedient Leninist"".[596] Stalin respected Lenin, but not uncritically,[597] and spoke out when he believed that Lenin was wrong.[596] During the period of his revolutionary activity, Stalin regarded some of Lenin\'s views and actions as being the self-indulgent activities of a spoilt émigré, deeming them counterproductive for those Bolshevik activists based within the Russian Empire itself.[598] After the October Revolution, they continued to have differences,[599] although Kotkin suggested that Stalin\'s friendship with Lenin was ""the single most important relationship in Stalin\'s life"".[600]', 'Stalin viewed nations as contingent entities which were formed by capitalism and could merge into others.[601] Ultimately, he believed that all nations would merge into a single, global community,[601] and regarded all nations as inherently equal.[602] In his work, he stated that ""the right of secession"" should be offered to the ethnic minorities of the Russian Empire, but that they should not be encouraged to take that option.[603] He was of the view that if they became fully autonomous, then they would end up being controlled by the most reactionary elements of their community.[603] Stalin\'s push for Soviet westward expansion into Eastern Europe resulted in accusations of Russian imperialism.[604]', 'Ethnically Georgian,[605] Stalin grew up speaking the Georgian language,[606] and did not begin learning Russian until age eight or nine.[607] It has been argued that his ancestry was genetically Ossetian, but he never acknowledged an Ossetian identity.[608] He remained proud of his Georgian identity,[609] and throughout his life retained a heavy Georgian accent when speaking Russian.[610][611] Some colleagues described him as ""Asiatic"", and he supposedly said that ""I am not a European man, but an Asian, a Russified Georgian"".[612]', 'Described as soft-spoken[613] and a poor orator,[614] Stalin\'s style was ""simple and clear, without flights of fancy, catchy phrases or platform histrionics"".[615] He rarely spoke before large audiences and preferred to express himself in writing.[616] In adulthood, Stalin measured 1.70\xa0m (5\xa0feet 7\xa0inches).[617][618] His moustached face was pock-marked from smallpox during childhood; this was airbrushed from published photographs.[619] His left arm had been injured in childhood which left it shorter than his right and lacking in flexibility.[620] Stalin was a lifelong smoker, who smoked both a pipe and cigarettes.[621] Publicly, he lived relatively plainly, with simple and inexpensive clothing and furniture.[622] As leader, Stalin rarely left Moscow unless for holiday;[623] he disliked travel,[624] and refused to by plane.[625] In 1934, his Kuntsevo Dacha was built 9\xa0km (5.6\xa0mi) from the Kremlin and became his primary residence.[626] He holidayed in the south USSR every year from 1925 to 1936 and 1945 to 1951,[627] often in Abkhazia, being a friend of its leader, Nestor Lakoba.[628]', 'Trotsky and several other Soviet figures promoted the idea that Stalin was a mediocrity,[629] a characterisation which gained widespread acceptance outside of the Soviet Union during his lifetime.[630] However, historians note that he possessed a complex mind,[631] remarkable self-control,[632] and excellent memory.[633] Stalin was a diligent worker[634] and an effective and strategic organiser,[635] with a keen interest in learning.[636] As a leader, he meticulously scrutinised details, from film scripts to military plans,[637] and judged others by their inner strength and cleverness.[638] He was skilled at playing different roles depending on the audience,[639] as well as in deception.[640]  Although he could be rude,[641] Stalin rarely raised his voice;[642] however, as his health deteriorated, he became unpredictable and bad-tempered.[643] He could be charming and enjoyed cracking jokes when relaxed.[636] At social events, Stalin encouraged singing and drinking, hoping others would drunkenly reveal secrets to him.[644]', 'Stalin lacked compassion,[645] possibly exacerbated by his repeated imprisonments and exiles,[646] though he occasionally showed kindness to strangers, even during the Great Purge.[647] He could be self-righteous,[648] resentful,[649] and vindictive,[650] often holding grudges for years.[651] By the 1920s, he had become suspicious and conspiratorial, prone to believing in plots against him and international conspiracies.[652] While he never attended torture sessions or executions,[653] Stalin took pleasure in degrading and humiliating people and kept even close associates in a state of ""unrelieved fear"".[604] Service suggested he had tendencies toward a paranoid and sociopathic personality disorder.[631] Historian E.A. Rees believed it was psychopathy that bred Stalin\'s tyranny, citing a 1927 diagnosis by neuropathologist Vladimir Bekhterev that described him as a ""typical case of severe paranoia"".[654] Others have linked Stalin\'s brutality to his commitment to the survival of the Soviet Union and Marxist–Leninist ideology.[655]', 'Stalin had a keen interest in the arts.[656] He protected certain Soviet writers, such as Mikhail Bulgakov, even when their work was criticised as harmful to his regime.[657] Stalin enjoyed classical music,[658] owned around 2,700 records,[659] and often attended the Bolshoi Theatre in the 1930s and 40s.[660] His taste was conservative, favouring classical drama, opera, and ballet over what he dismissed as experimental ""formalism"",[607] and disliked avant-garde in the visual arts.[661] An autodidact despite his limited formal education,[662] Stalin was a voracious reader who kept over 20,000 books,[663] with little fiction.[664] His favourite subject was history, and he was especially interested in the reigns of Russian leaders Ivan the Terrible, Peter the Great, and Catherine the Great.[665] Lenin was his favourite author, but he read and appreciated works by Trotsky and other adversaries.[665]', 'Stalin married his first wife, Ekaterina Svanidze, in 1906. Volkogonov suggested that she was ""probably the one human being he had really loved"".[666] When she died, Stalin allegedly said: ""This creature softened my heart of stone. She died and with her died my last warm feelings for humanity.""[667] They had a son, Yakov, who frequently frustrated and annoyed Stalin.[668] After Yakov was captured by the German Army during World War II, Stalin refused to agree to a prisoner exchange between him and German field marshal Friedrich Paulus, and Yakov died at a Nazi concentration camp in 1943.[669]', ""In exile in Solvychegodsk in 1910, Stalin had an affair with his landlady, Maria Kuzakova, who in 1911 gave birth to his alleged second son, Konstantin Kuzakov,[670] who later taught philosophy at the Leningrad Military Mechanical Institute, but never met Stalin.[671] In 1914 in Kureika, Stalin, aged 35, had a relationship with Lidia Pereprygina, aged 14 (considered a minor at the time), who allegedly became pregnant with Stalin's child.[672][673] In December 1914, Pereprygina gave birth to the child, although the infant died soon after.[674] In 1916, Pereprygina was pregnant again. She gave birth to their alleged son, Alexander Davydov, in around April 1917. He was raised as the son of a peasant fisherman;[675] Stalin later came to know of the child's existence but showed no interest in him.[676]"", ""Stalin's second wife was Nadezhda Alliluyeva, whom he married in 1919; theirs was not an easy relationship, they often fought.[677] They had two biological children—a son, Vasily, and daughter, Svetlana—and adopted another son, Artyom Sergeev, in 1921.[678] It is unclear if Stalin had a mistress during or after this marriage.[679] She suspected he was unfaithful,[680] and committed suicide in 1932.[681] Stalin regarded Vasily as spoilt and often chastised his behaviour; as Stalin's son, he was swiftly promoted through the Red Army and allowed a lavish lifestyle.[682] Conversely, Stalin had an affectionate relationship with Svetlana during her childhood,[683] and was very fond of Artyom.[678] He disapproved of Svetlana's suitors and husbands, which put strain on their relationship.[684] After World War II, he made little time for his children, and his family played a diminishing role in his life.[685] After Stalin's death, Svetlana changed her surname to Alliluyeva,[576] and defected to the U.S.[686]"", 'The historian Robert Conquest stated that Stalin perhaps ""determined the course of the twentieth century"" more than any other individual.[687] Leninists remain divided in their views on Stalin; some view him as Lenin\'s authentic successor, while others believe he betrayed Lenin\'s ideas by deviating from them.[604] For most Westerners and anti-communist Russians, he is viewed overwhelmingly negatively as a mass murderer;[688] for significant numbers of Russians and Georgians, he is regarded as a great statesman and state-builder.[688] The historian Dmitri Volkogonov characterised him as ""one of the most powerful figures in human history.""[689]', 'According to Service, Stalin strengthened and stabilised the Soviet Union.[690] In under three decades, Stalin transformed the country into a major industrial world power,[691] one which could ""claim impressive achievements"" in terms of urbanisation, military strength, education and Soviet pride.[692] Under his rule, the average Soviet life expectancy grew due to improved living conditions, nutrition and medical care[693] as mortality rates declined.[694] Although millions of Soviet citizens despised him, support for Stalin was nevertheless widespread throughout Soviet society.[692] Conversely, the historian Vadim Rogovin argued that Stalin\'s purges ""caused losses to the communist movement both in the USSR and throughout the world from which the movement has not recovered to this very day"".[695] Similarly, Nikita Khrushchev believed his purges of the Old Bolsheviks and leading figures in the military and academia had ""undoubtedly"" weakened the nation.[696]', 'Stalin\'s necessity for the Soviet Union\'s economic development has been questioned, and it has been argued that his policies from 1928 onwards may have been a limiting factor.[697] Stalin\'s Soviet Union has been characterised as a totalitarian state,[698] with Stalin its authoritarian leader.[699] Various biographers have described him as a dictator,[700] an autocrat,[701] or accused him of practising Caesarism.[702] Montefiore argued that while Stalin initially ruled as part of a Communist Party oligarchy, the government transformed into a personal dictatorship in 1934,[703] with Stalin only becoming ""absolute dictator"" after March–June 1937, when senior military and NKVD figures were eliminated.[704] In both the Soviet Union and elsewhere he came to be portrayed as an ""Oriental despot"".[705] McDermott nevertheless cautioned against ""over-simplistic stereotypes""—promoted in the fiction of writers like Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn—which portrayed Stalin as an omnipotent and omnipresent tyrant who controlled every aspect of Soviet life.[706]', 'A vast literature devoted to Stalin has been produced.[707] During Stalin\'s lifetime, his approved biographies were largely hagiographic in content.[708] Stalin ensured that these works gave very little attention to his early life, particularly because he did not wish to emphasise his Georgian origins in a state numerically dominated by Russians.[709] Since his death many more biographies have been written,[710] although until the 1980s these relied largely on the same sources of information.[710] Under Mikhail Gorbachev\'s Soviet administration various previously classified files on Stalin\'s life were made available to historians,[710] at which point he became ""one of the most urgent and vital issues on the public agenda"" in the Soviet Union.[711] After the dissolution of the Union in 1991, the rest of the archives were opened to historians, resulting in much new information about Stalin coming to light,[712] and producing a flood of new research.[707]', ""Before the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the archival revelations, some Western historians estimated that the numbers killed by Stalin's regime were 20 million or higher.[713][714][715] The scholarly consensus affirms that Soviet archival materials declassified in 1991 contain irrefutable data much lower than Western sources used prior to 1991, such as statements from emigres and other informants.[716]"", 'After the Soviet Union dissolved, evidence from the Soviet archives was declassified, and researchers were allowed to study it. This contained official records of 799,455 executions (1921–1953),[717] around 1.7\xa0million deaths in the Gulag,[718][719] some 390,000[720] deaths during the dekulakisation forced resettlement, and up to 400,000 deaths of persons deported during the 1940s,[721] with a total of about 3.3 million officially recorded victims in these categories.[722] According to historian Stephen Wheatcroft, approximately 1 million of these deaths were ""purposive"" while the rest happened through neglect and irresponsibility.[723]', 'The deaths of at least 3.5 to 6.5 million[724] persons in the Soviet famine of 1932–1933 are sometimes, though not always, included with the victims of the Stalin era.[723] Stalin has also been accused of genocide in the cases of forced population transfer of ethnic minorities across the Soviet Union and the Holodomor famine[725]  However, British historian Michael Ellman argues that mass deaths from famines should be placed in a different category than the repression victims, mentioning that throughout Russian history famines and droughts have been a common occurrence.[726] Famines were widespread throughout the world in the 19th and 20th centuries in countries such as China, India, Ireland, and Russia.[727] Ellman compared the behaviour of the Stalinist regime to that of the British government (towards Ireland and India) and the G8 in contemporary times, and Stalin\'s ""behaviour was no worse than that of many rulers in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.""[727]', 'Shortly after his death, the Soviet Union went through a period of de-Stalinisation. Malenkov denounced the Stalin personality cult,[728] and the cult was subsequently criticised in Pravda.[729] In 1956, Khrushchev gave his ""Secret Speech"", titled ""On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences"", to a closed session of the Party\'s 20th Congress. There, Khrushchev denounced Stalin for both his mass repression and his personality cult.[730] He repeated these denunciations at the 22nd Party Congress in October 1962.[731] In October 1961, Stalin\'s body was removed from the mausoleum and buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis, the location marked by a bust.[732] Stalingrad was renamed Volgograd that year.[733]', ""Khrushchev's de-Stalinisation process ended when he was replaced as leader by Leonid Brezhnev in 1964; the latter introduced a level of re-Stalinisation within the Soviet Union.[734] In 1969 and again in 1979, plans were proposed for a full rehabilitation of Stalin's legacy but on both occasions were halted due to fears of damaging the USSR's public image.[735] Mikhail Gorbachev saw the total denunciation of Stalin as necessary for the regeneration of Soviet society.[736] "", ""After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Boris Yeltsin continued Gorbachev's denunciation of Stalin but added to it a denunciation of Lenin.[736] His successor Vladimir Putin did not seek to rehabilitate Stalin but emphasised the celebration of Soviet achievements under Stalin's leadership rather than the Stalinist repressions.[737] In October 2017, Putin opened the Wall of Grief memorial in Moscow.[738] In recent years, the government and general public of Russia has been accused of rehabilitating Stalin.[739]""]","Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin[f] (born Dzhugashvili;[g] 18 December [O.S. 6 December] 1878 – 5 March 1953) was a Soviet politician and revolutionary who led the Soviet Union from 1924 until his death in 1953. He held power as General Secretary of the Communist Party from 1922 to 1952 and as Chairman of the Council of Ministers from 1941 until his death. Initially governing as part of a collective leadership, Stalin consolidated power to become a dictator by the 1930s. He codified his Leninist interpretation of Marxism as Marxism–Leninism, while the totalitarian political system he established became known as Stalinism.","Here are some key points about Stalin's biography and legacy:

1. **Limited information**: Many biographies of Stalin were written with a hagiographic tone, and he was often not given much attention in his early life.
2. **Archival revelations**: After the Soviet Union dissolved, many previously classified files on Stalin's life were made available to historians, revealing new information about his regime.
3. **Death toll estimates**: Historians estimated that 20 million or more people were killed by Stalin's regime, but archival data revealed a lower number, around 3-4 million officially recorded victims.
4. **Famine and genocide accusations**: Some historians argue that Stalin was responsible for the deaths of up to 6.5 million people in the Soviet famine of 1932-1933, and accused him of genocide in other cases.
5. **Rehabilitation attempts**: Various leaders, including Khrushchev, Brezhnev, and Gorbachev, attempted to rehabilitate Stalin's legacy, but these efforts were often halted due to concerns about damaging the Soviet Union's public image.
6. **Post-Soviet developments**: After the fall of the Soviet Union, Boris Yeltsin continued to denounce Stalin, while Vladimir Putin has emphasized the celebration of Soviet achievements under Stalin's leadership rather than his repressions.
7. **Recent trends**: In recent years, there have been efforts to rehabilitate Stalin in Russia, including the opening of a memorial wall in Moscow and the downplaying of his atrocities.

Some historians and experts have differing opinions on Stalin's legacy:

* **Michael Ellman** argues that mass deaths from famines should be placed in a different category than repression victims.
* **British historian Stephen Wheatcroft** estimates that approximately 1 million of Stalin's victims died due to ""purposive"" actions, while the rest were due to neglect and irresponsibility.

Harry_S._Truman,"[""Harry S. Truman  (May 8, 1884\xa0– December 26, 1972) was the 33rd president of the United States, serving from 1945 to 1953. A member of the Democratic Party, he assumed the presidency after Franklin D. Roosevelt's death, as he was vice president at the time. Truman implemented the Marshall Plan in the wake of World War II to rebuild the economy of Western Europe and established both the Truman Doctrine and NATO to contain the expansion of Soviet communism. He proposed numerous liberal domestic reforms, but few were enacted by the conservative coalition that dominated Congress."", 'Truman was raised in Independence, Missouri, and during World War I fought in France as a captain in the Field Artillery. Returning home, he opened a haberdashery in Kansas City, Missouri, and was elected as a judge of Jackson County in 1922. Truman was elected to the United States Senate from Missouri in 1934. Between 1940 and 1944, he gained national prominence as chairman of the Truman Committee, which was aimed at reducing waste and inefficiency in wartime contracts.', ""Truman was elected vice president in the 1944 presidential election and became president upon Roosevelt's death in April 1945. Only then was he told about the ongoing Manhattan Project and the atomic bomb. Truman authorized the first and only use of nuclear weapons in war against the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Truman's administration engaged in an internationalist foreign policy by working closely with Britain. Truman staunchly denounced isolationism. He energized the New Deal coalition during the 1948 presidential election, despite a divided Democratic Party, and won a surprise victory against Republican Party nominee Thomas E. Dewey that secured his own presidential term."", 'Truman presided over the onset of the Cold War in 1947. He oversaw the Berlin Airlift and Marshall Plan in 1948. With the involvement of the US in the Korean War of 1950–1953, South Korea repelled the invasion by North Korea. Domestically, the postwar economic challenges such as strikes and inflation created a mixed reaction over the effectiveness of his administration. In 1948, he proposed Congress pass comprehensive civil rights legislation. Congress refused, so Truman issued Executive Order 9980 and Executive Order 9981, which prohibited discrimination in federal agencies and desegregated the U.S. Armed Forces.', ""Investigations revealed corruption in parts of the Truman administration, and this became a major campaign issue in the 1952 presidential election, although they did not implicate Truman himself. He was eligible for reelection in 1952 but, with poor polling, he chose not to run. Truman went into a retirement marked by the founding of his presidential library and the publication of his memoirs. It was long thought that his retirement years were financially difficult for Truman, resulting in Congress establishing a pension for former presidents, but evidence eventually emerged that he amassed considerable wealth, some of it while still president. When he left office, Truman's administration was heavily criticized. Despite this controversy, scholars rank Truman in the first quartile of American presidents. In addition, critical reassessment of his presidency has improved his reputation among historians and the general population.[1]"", 'Truman was born in Lamar, Missouri, on May 8, 1884, the oldest child of John Anderson Truman and Martha Ellen Young Truman. He was named for his maternal uncle, Harrison ""Harry"" Young. His middle initial, ""S"", is not an abbreviation of one particular name. Rather, it honors both his grandfathers, Anderson Shipp Truman and Solomon Young, a somewhat common practice in the American South at the time.[b][3] A brother, John Vivian, was born soon after Harry, followed by sister Mary Jane.[4] While Truman\'s ancestry was primarily English, he also had some Scots-Irish, German, and French ancestry.[5][6]', ""John Truman was a farmer and livestock dealer. The family lived in Lamar until Harry was ten months old, when they moved to a farm near Harrisonville, Missouri. They next moved to Belton and in 1887 to his grandparents' 600-acre (240\xa0ha) farm in Grandview.[7] When Truman was six, his parents moved to Independence, Missouri, so he could attend the Presbyterian Church Sunday School. He did not attend a conventional school until he was eight years old.[8] While living in Independence, he served as a Shabbos goy for Jewish neighbors, doing tasks for them on Shabbat that their religion prevented them from doing on that day.[9][10][11]"", ""Truman was interested in music, reading, history, and math,[12] all encouraged by his mother, with whom he was very close. As president, he solicited political as well as personal advice from her.[13] Truman learned to play the piano at age seven and took lessons from Mrs. E.C. White, a well-respected teacher in Kansas City.[14] He got up at five o'clock every morning to practice the piano, which he studied more than twice a week until he was fifteen, becoming quite a skilled player.[15] Truman worked as a page at the 1900 Democratic National Convention in Kansas City;[16] his father had many friends active in the Democratic Party who helped young Harry to gain his first political position.[17]"", ""After graduating from Independence High School in 1901,[18] Truman took classes at Spalding's Commercial College, a Kansas City business school. He studied bookkeeping, shorthand, and typing but stopped after a year.[19]"", 'Segregation was practiced and largely accepted where Truman grew up. While he later came to support civil rights, early letters of the young Truman reflected his upbringing and prejudices against African and Asian Americans.[20]', ""Truman was employed briefly in the mailroom of The Kansas City Star[21] before making use of his business college experience to obtain a job as a timekeeper for construction crews on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, which required him to sleep in workmen's camps along the rail lines.[22] Truman and his brother Vivian later worked as clerks at the National Bank of Commerce in Kansas City.[23]"", 'In 1906, Truman returned to the Grandview farm, where he lived until entering the army in 1917.[24] During this period, he courted Bess Wallace.[25] He proposed in 1911, but she turned him down.[26] Believing Wallace turned him down because he did not have much money, Truman later said he intended to propose again, but he wanted to have a better income than that earned by a farmer.[27] In fact, Wallace later told Truman she did not intend to marry, but if she did, it would be to him.[26] Still determined to improve his finances, during his years on the farm and immediately after World War I, Truman became active in several business ventures. These included a lead and zinc mine near Commerce, Oklahoma, a company that bought land and leased the oil drilling rights to prospectors, and speculation in Kansas City real estate.[28] Truman occasionally derived some income from these enterprises, but none proved successful in the long term.[29]', 'Truman is the only president since William McKinley (elected in 1896) who did not earn a college degree.[30] In addition to having briefly attended business college, from 1923 to 1925 he took night courses toward an LL.B. at the Kansas City Law School (now the University of Missouri–Kansas City School of Law) but dropped out after losing reelection as county judge.[31] He was informed by attorneys in the Kansas City area that his education and experience were probably sufficient to receive a license to practice law but did not pursue it because he won election as presiding judge.[32]', ""While serving as president in 1947, Truman applied for a law license.[33] A friend who was an attorney began working out the arrangements, and informed Truman that his application had to be notarized. By the time Truman received this information he had changed his mind, so he never followed up. After the discovery of Truman's application in 1996 the Missouri Supreme Court issued him a posthumous honorary law license.[34]"", 'Due to the lack of funds for college, Truman considered attending the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, which had no tuition, but he was refused an appointment because of poor eyesight.[31] He enlisted in the Missouri National Guard in 1905 and served until 1911 in the Kansas City-based Battery B, 2nd Missouri Field Artillery Regiment, in which he attained the rank of corporal.[35] At his induction, his eyesight without glasses was unacceptable 20/50 in the right eye and 20/400 in the left (past the standard for legal blindness).[36] The second time he took the test, he passed by secretly memorizing the eye chart.[37] He was described as 5 feet 10 inches tall, gray eyed, dark haired and of light complexion.[38]', ""When the United States entered World War I on April 6, 1917, Truman rejoined Battery B, successfully recruiting new soldiers for the expanding unit, for which he was elected as their first lieutenant.[39] Before deployment to France, Truman was sent for training to Camp Doniphan, Fort Sill, near Lawton, Oklahoma, when his regiment was federalized as the 129th Field Artillery.[40] The regimental commander during its training was Robert M. Danford, who later served as the Army's Chief of Field Artillery.[41] Truman recalled that he learned more practical, useful information from Danford in six weeks than from six months of formal Army instruction, and when Truman served as an artillery instructor, he consciously patterned his approach on Danford's.[41]"", ""Truman also ran the camp canteen with Edward Jacobson, a clothing store clerk he knew from Kansas City. Unlike most canteens funded by unit members, which usually lost money, the canteen operated by Truman and Jacobson turned a profit, returning each soldier's initial $2 investment and $10,000 in dividends in six months.[35] At Fort Sill, Truman met Lieutenant James M. Pendergast, nephew of Tom Pendergast, a Kansas City political boss, a connection that had a profound influence on Truman's later life.[42][43]"", 'In mid-1918, about one million soldiers of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) were in France.[44] Truman was promoted to captain effective April 23,[45] and in July became commander of the newly arrived Battery D, 129th Field Artillery, 35th Division.[46][47] Battery D was known for its discipline problems, and Truman was initially unpopular because of his efforts to restore order.[35] Despite attempts by the men to intimidate him into quitting, Truman succeeded by making his corporals and sergeants accountable for discipline. He promised to back them up if they performed capably and reduce them to private if they did not.[48] In an event memorialized in battery lore as ""The Battle of Who Run"", his soldiers began to flee during a sudden night attack by the Germans in the Vosges Mountains; Truman succeeded at ordering his men to stay and fight, using profanity from his railroad days. The men were so surprised to hear Truman use such language that they immediately obeyed.[35]', ""Truman's unit joined in a massive prearranged assault barrage on September 26, 1918, at the opening of the Meuse–Argonne offensive.[49] They advanced with difficulty over pitted terrain to follow the infantry, and set up an observation post west of Cheppy.[49] On September 27, Truman saw through his binoculars an enemy artillery battery deploying across a river in a position which would allow them to fire upon the neighboring 28th Division.[49] Truman's orders limited him to targets facing the 35th Division, but he ignored this and patiently waited until the Germans had walked their horses well away from their guns, ensuring they could not relocate out of range of Truman's battery.[49] He then ordered his men to open fire, and their attack destroyed the enemy battery.[49] His actions were credited with saving the lives of 28th Division soldiers who otherwise would have come under fire from the Germans.[50][51] Truman was given a dressing down by his regimental commander, Colonel Karl D. Klemm, who threatened to convene a court-martial, but Klemm never followed through, and Truman was not punished.[49]"", ""In other action during the Meuse–Argonne offensive, Truman's battery provided support for George S. Patton's tank brigade,[52] and fired some of the last shots of the war on November 11, 1918. Battery D did not lose any men while under Truman's command in France. To show their appreciation for his leadership, his men presented him with a large loving cup upon their return to the United States after the war.[35]"", 'The war was a transformative experience in which Truman manifested his leadership qualities. He had entered the service in 1917 as a family farmer who had worked in clerical jobs that did not require the ability to motivate and direct others, but during the war, he gained leadership experience and a record of success that greatly enhanced and supported his post-war political career in Missouri.[35]', 'Truman was brought up in the Presbyterian and Baptist churches,[53] but avoided revivals and sometimes ridiculed revivalist preachers.[54] He rarely spoke about religion, which to him, primarily meant ethical behavior along traditional Protestant lines.[55] Truman once wrote in a letter to his future wife, Bess: ""You know that I know nothing about Lent and such things...""[56] Most of the soldiers he commanded in the war were Catholics, and one of his close friends was the 129th Field Artillery\'s chaplain, Monsignor L. Curtis Tiernan.[57] The two remained friends until Tiernan\'s death in 1960.[58] Developing leadership and interpersonal skills that later made him a successful politician helped Truman get along with his Catholic soldiers, as he did with soldiers of other Christian denominations and the unit\'s Jewish members.[59][60]', 'Truman was honorably discharged from the Army as a captain on May 6, 1919.[61] In 1920, he was appointed a major in the Officers Reserve Corps.[62] He became a lieutenant colonel in 1925 and a colonel in 1932.[63] In the 1920s and 1930s he commanded 1st Battalion, 379th Field Artillery Regiment, 102nd Infantry Division.[64] After promotion to colonel, Truman advanced to command of the regiment.[65]', 'After his election to the U.S. Senate, Truman was transferred to the General Assignments Group, a holding unit for less active officers, although he had not been consulted in advance.[66] Truman protested his reassignment, which led to his resumption of regimental command.[66] He remained an active reservist until the early 1940s.[67] Truman volunteered for active military service during World War II, but was not accepted, partly because of age, and partly because President Franklin D. Roosevelt desired that senators and congressmen who belonged to the military reserves support the war effort by remaining in Congress, or by ending their active duty service and resuming their congressional seats.[68] He was an inactive reservist from the early 1940s until retiring as a colonel in the then redesignated U.S. Army Reserve on January 20, 1953.[69]', 'Truman was awarded a World War I Victory Medal with two battle clasps (for St. Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne) and a Defensive Sector Clasp. He was also the recipient of two Armed Forces Reserve Medals.[70]', 'After his wartime service, Truman returned to Independence, where he married Bess Wallace on June 28, 1919.[71] The couple had one child, Mary Margaret Truman.[72]', ""Shortly before the wedding, Truman and Jacobson opened a haberdashery together at 104 West 12th Street in downtown Kansas City.[73] After brief initial success, the store went bankrupt during the recession of 1921.[13] Truman did not pay off the last of the debts from that venture until 1935, when he did so with the aid of banker William T. Kemper, who worked behind the scenes to enable Truman's brother Vivian to buy Truman's $5,600 promissory note during the asset sale of a bank that had failed in the Great Depression.[74][75] The note had risen and fallen in value as it was bought and sold, interest accumulated and Truman made payments, so by the time the last bank to hold it failed, it was worth nearly $9,000.[76] Thanks to Kemper's efforts, Vivian Truman was able to buy it for $1,000.[75] Jacobson and Truman remained close friends even after their store failed, and Jacobson's advice to Truman on Zionism later played a role in the U.S. Government's decision to recognize Israel.[77]"", ""With the help of the Kansas City Democratic machine led by Tom Pendergast, Truman was elected in 1922 as County Court judge of Jackson County's eastern district—Jackson County's three-judge court included judges from the western district (Kansas City), the eastern district (the county outside Kansas City), and a presiding judge elected countywide. This was an administrative rather than a judicial court, similar to county commissions in many other jurisdictions. Truman succeeded James E. Gilday and served from January 1, 1923 to January 1, 1925.[78] He lost his 1924 reelection campaign to Henry Rummel in a Republican wave led by President Calvin Coolidge's landslide election to a full term.[79] Two years selling automobile club memberships convinced him that a public service career was safer for a family man approaching middle age, and he planned a run for presiding judge in 1926.[80]"", 'Truman won the job in 1926 with the support of the Pendergast machine, and succeeded Elihu W. Hayes.[81] Truman was re-elected in 1930; he served from January 1, 1927 to January 1, 1935 and was succeeded by Eugene I. Purcell.[79] As presiding judge, Truman helped coordinate the Ten Year Plan, which transformed Jackson County and the Kansas City skyline with new public works projects, including an extensive series of roads and construction of a new Wight and Wight-designed County Court building. Also in 1926, he became president of the National Old Trails Road Association, and during his term he oversaw dedication of 12 Madonna of the Trail monuments to honor pioneer women.[80][82]', ""In 1933, Truman was named Missouri's director for the Federal Re-Employment program (part of the Civil Works Administration) at the request of Postmaster General James Farley. This was payback to Pendergast for delivering the Kansas City vote to Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1932 presidential election. The appointment confirmed Pendergast's control over federal patronage jobs in Missouri and marked the zenith of his power. It also created a relationship between Truman and Roosevelt's aide Harry Hopkins and assured Truman's avid support for the New Deal.[83]"", ""After serving as a county judge, Truman wanted to run for governor of Missouri or Congress,[84][85] but Pendergast rejected these ideas. Truman then thought he might serve out his career in some well-paying county sinecure;[85] circumstances changed when Pendergast reluctantly backed him as the machine's choice in the 1934 Democratic primary election for the U.S. Senate from Missouri, after Pendergast's first four choices had declined to run.[86] In the primary, Truman defeated Congressmen John J. Cochran and Jacob L. Milligan with the solid support of Jackson County, which was crucial to his candidacy. Also critical were the contacts he had made statewide in his capacity as a county official, member of the Freemasons,[c] military reservist,[d] and member of the American Legion.[e][90] In the general election, Truman defeated incumbent Republican Roscoe C. Patterson by nearly 20\xa0percentage points in a continuing wave of pro-New Deal Democrats elected during the Great Depression.[86][91][92]"", 'Truman assumed office with a reputation as ""the Senator from Pendergast"". He referred patronage decisions to Pendergast but maintained that he voted with his own conscience. He later defended the patronage decisions by saying that ""by offering a little to the machine, [he] saved a lot"".[92][93] In his first term, Truman spoke out against corporate greed and the dangers of Wall Street speculators and other moneyed special interests attaining too much influence in national affairs.[94] Though he served on the high-profile Appropriations and Interstate Commerce Committees, he was largely ignored by President Roosevelt and had trouble getting calls returned from the White House.[92][95]', ""During the U.S. Senate election in 1940, U.S. Attorney Maurice Milligan (former opponent Jacob Milligan's brother) and former governor Lloyd Stark both challenged Truman in the Democratic primary. Truman was politically weakened by Pendergast's imprisonment for income tax evasion the previous year; the senator had remained loyal, having claimed that Republican judges (not the Roosevelt administration) were responsible for the boss's downfall.[96] St. Louis party leader Robert E. Hannegan's support of Truman proved crucial; he later brokered the deal that put Truman on the national ticket. In the end, Stark and Milligan split the anti-Pendergast vote in the Senate Democratic primary and Truman won by a total of 8,000\xa0votes. In the November election, Truman defeated Republican Manvel H. Davis by 51–49\xa0percent.[97] As senator, Truman opposed both Nazi Germany and Communist Russia. Two days after Hitler invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, Truman said:"", ""If we see that Germany is winning we ought to help Russia, and if Russia is winning we ought to help Germany, and that way let them kill as many as possible although I don't want to see Hitler victorious under any circumstances.[98]"", 'This quote without its last part later became a staple in Soviet and later Russian propaganda as ""evidence"" of an American conspiracy to destroy the country.[99][100]', 'In late 1940, Truman traveled to various military bases. The waste and profiteering he saw led him to use his chairmanship of the Committee on Military Affairs Subcommittee on War Mobilization to start investigations into abuses while the nation prepared for war. A new special committee was set up under Truman to conduct a formal investigation; the White House supported this plan rather than weather a more hostile probe by the House of Representatives. The main mission of the committee was to expose and fight waste and corruption in the gigantic government wartime contracts.', 'Truman\'s initiative convinced Senate leaders of the necessity for the committee, which reflected his demands for honest and efficient administration and his distrust of big business and Wall Street. Truman managed the committee ""with extraordinary skill"" and usually achieved consensus, generating heavy media publicity that gave him a national reputation.[101][102] Activities of the Truman Committee ranged from criticizing the ""dollar-a-year men"" hired by the government, many of whom proved ineffective, to investigating a shoddily built New Jersey housing project for war workers.[103][104] In March 1944, Truman attempted to probe the expensive Manhattan Project but was persuaded by Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson to discontinue with the investigation.[105]:\u200a634\u200a', 'The committee reportedly saved as much as $15\xa0billion (equivalent to $260\xa0billion in 2023),[106][107][108][109] and its activities put Truman on the cover of Time magazine.[110] According to the Senate\'s historical minutes, in leading the committee, ""Truman erased his earlier public image as an errand-runner for Kansas City politicos"", and ""no senator ever gained greater political benefits from chairing a special investigating committee than did Missouri\'s Harry S. Truman.""[111]', ""Roosevelt's advisors knew that Roosevelt might not live out a fourth term and that his vice president would very likely become the next president. Henry Wallace had served as Roosevelt's vice president for four years and was popular on the left, but he was viewed as too far to the left and too friendly to labor for some of Roosevelt's advisers. The President and several of his confidantes wanted to replace Wallace with someone more acceptable to Democratic Party leaders. Outgoing Democratic National Committee chairman Frank C. Walker, incoming chairman Hannegan, party treasurer Edwin W. Pauley, Bronx party boss Ed Flynn, Chicago Mayor Edward Joseph Kelly, and lobbyist George E. Allen all wanted to keep Wallace off the ticket.[112] Roosevelt told party leaders that he would accept either Truman or Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas.[113]"", 'State and city party leaders strongly preferred Truman, and Roosevelt agreed.[114] Truman had repeatedly said that he was not in the race and that he did not want the vice presidency, and he remained reluctant.[114] One reason was that his wife and sister Mary Jane were both on his Senate staff payroll, and he feared negative publicity.[114] Truman did not campaign for the vice-presidential spot, though he welcomed the attention as evidence that he had become more than the ""Senator from Pendergast"".[115] Truman\'s nomination was dubbed the ""Second Missouri Compromise"" and was well received. The Roosevelt–Truman ticket achieved a 432–99\xa0electoral-vote victory in the election, defeating the Republican ticket of Governor Thomas E. Dewey of New York and running mate Governor John Bricker of Ohio. Truman was sworn in as vice president on January 20, 1945.[116] After the inauguration, Truman called his mother, who instructed him, ""Now you behave yourself.""[117]', ""Truman's brief vice-presidency was relatively uneventful. Truman mostly presided over the Senate and attended parties and receptions. He kept the same offices from his Senate years, mostly only using the Vice President's official office in the Capitol to greet visitors. Truman was the first vice president to have a Secret Service agent assigned to him. Truman envisioned the office as a liaison between the Senate and the president.[118] On April 10, 1945,[119] Truman cast his only tie-breaking vote as president of the Senate, against a Robert A. Taft amendment that would have blocked the postwar delivery of Lend-Lease Act items contracted for during the war.[120][121] Roosevelt rarely contacted him, even to inform him of major decisions; the president and vice president met alone together only twice during their time in office.[122]"", 'In one of his first acts as vice president, Truman created some controversy when he attended the disgraced Pendergast\'s funeral. He brushed aside the criticism, saying simply, ""He was always my friend and I have always been his.""[13] He had rarely discussed world affairs or domestic politics with Roosevelt; he was uninformed about major initiatives relating to the war and the top-secret Manhattan Project, which was about to test the world\'s first atomic bomb.[123] In an event that generated negative publicity for Truman, he was photographed with actress Lauren Bacall sitting atop the piano at the National Press Club as he played for soldiers.[124]', 'Truman had been vice president for 82\xa0days when President Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945.[123] Truman, presiding over the Senate, as usual, had just adjourned the session for the day and was preparing to have a drink in House Speaker Sam Rayburn\'s office when he received an urgent message to go immediately to the White House, where Eleanor Roosevelt told him that her husband had died after a massive cerebral hemorrhage. Truman asked her if there was anything he could do for her; she replied, ""Is there anything we can do for you? For you are the one in trouble now!""[125][126][127] He was sworn in as president at 7:09\xa0p.m. in the West Wing of the White House, by Chief Justice Harlan F. Stone.[128]', 'At the White House, Truman replaced Roosevelt holdovers with old confidants. The White House was badly understaffed with no more than a dozen aides; they could barely keep up with the heavy workflow of a greatly expanded executive department. Truman acted as his own chief of staff on a daily basis, as well as his own liaison with Congress—a body he already knew very well. He was not well prepared to deal with the press, and never achieved the jovial familiarity of FDR. Filled with latent anger about all the setbacks in his career, he bitterly mistrusted journalists. He saw them as enemies lying in wait for his next careless miscue. Truman was a very hard worker, often to the point of exhaustion, which left him testy, easily annoyed, and on the verge of appearing unpresidential or petty. In terms of major issues, he discussed them in depth with top advisors. He mastered the details of the federal budget as well as anyone. Truman was a poor speaker reading a text. However, his visible anger made him an effective stump speaker, denouncing his enemies as his supporters hollered back at him ""Give Em Hell, Harry!""[129]', 'Truman surrounded himself with friends and appointed several to high positions that seemed beyond their competence, including his two secretaries of the treasury, Fred Vinson and John Snyder. His closest friend in the White House was his military aide Harry H. Vaughan, who knew little of military or foreign affairs and was criticized for trading access to the White House for expensive gifts.[130][131] Truman loved to spend as much time as possible playing poker, telling stories and sipping bourbon. Alonzo Hamby notes that:', '... to many in the general public, gambling and bourbon swilling, however low-key, were not quite presidential. Neither was the intemperant ""give \'em hell"" campaign style nor the occasional profane phrase uttered in public. Poker exemplified a larger problem: the tension between his attempts at an image of leadership necessarily a cut above the ordinary and an informality that at times appeared to verge on crudeness.[132][133]', 'On his first full day, Truman told reporters: ""Boys, if you ever pray, pray for me now. I don\'t know if you fellas ever had a load of hay fall on you, but when they told me what happened yesterday, I felt like the moon, the stars, and all the planets had fallen on me.""[134]', ""Truman asked all the members of Roosevelt's cabinet to remain in place, but he soon replaced almost all of them, especially with friends from his Senate days.[135]"", 'Truman benefited from a honeymoon period from the success in defeating Nazi Germany in Europe and the nation celebrated V-E Day on May 8, 1945, his 61st birthday.[136]', 'Although Truman was told briefly on the afternoon of April 12 that the United States had a new, highly destructive weapon, it was not until April 25 that Secretary of War Henry Stimson told him the details:[137]', 'We have discovered the most terrible bomb in the history of the world. It may be the fire destruction prophesied in the Euphrates Valley Era, after Noah and his fabulous Ark.', 'Truman journeyed to Berlin for the Potsdam Conference with Joseph Stalin and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. He was there when he learned the Trinity test—the first atomic bomb—on July 16 had been successful. He hinted to Stalin that he was about to use a new kind of weapon against the Japanese. Though this was the first time the Soviets had been officially given information about the atomic bomb, Stalin was already aware of the bomb project—having learned about it through atomic espionage long before Truman did.[140][141][142]', 'In August, the Japanese government refused surrender demands as specifically outlined in the Potsdam Declaration. With the invasion of Japan imminent, Truman approved the schedule for dropping the two available bombs. Truman maintained the position that attacking Japan with atomic bombs saved many lives on both sides; a military estimate for the invasion of Japan submitted to Truman by Herbert Hoover indicated that an invasion could take at least a year and result in 500,000 to 1,000,000 Allied casualties.[143] A study done for the staff of Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson by William Shockley estimated that invading Japan would cost 1.7–4 million American casualties, including 400,000–800,000 fatalities, and five to ten million Japanese fatalities if Japanese civilians participated in the defense of Japan.[144] The U.S. Army Service Forces estimated in their document ""Redeployment of the United States Army after the Defeat of Germany,"" that between June 1945 and December 1946 the Army would be required to furnish replacements for 43,000 dead and evacuated wounded every month during this period.[145] From analysis of the replacement schedule and projected strengths in overseas theaters, it suggested that Army losses alone in those categories, excluding the Navy and Marine Corps, would be approximately 863,000 through the first part of 1947, of whom 267,000 would be killed or missing.[146]', 'Hiroshima was bombed on August 6, and Nagasaki three days later, leaving 105,000\xa0dead.[147] The Soviet Union declared war on Japan on August 9 and invaded Manchuria. Japan agreed to surrender the following day.[148][149]', ""Supporters[f] of Truman's decision argue that, given the tenacious Japanese defense of the outlying islands, the bombings saved hundreds of thousands of lives of Allied prisoners, Japanese civilians, and combatants on both sides that would have been lost in an invasion of Japan. Some modern criticism has argued that the use of nuclear weapons was unnecessary, given that conventional attacks or a demonstrative bombing of an uninhabited area might have forced Japan's surrender, and therefore assert that the attack constituted a crime of war.[150][151][152] In 1948 Truman defended his decision to use atomic bombs:"", 'As President of the United States, I had the fateful responsibility of deciding whether or not to use this weapon for the first time. It was the hardest decision I ever had to make. But the President cannot duck hard problems—he cannot pass the buck. I made the decision after discussions with the ablest men in our Government, and after long and prayerful consideration. I decided that the bomb should be used to end the war quickly and save countless lives—Japanese as well as American.[153]', 'Truman continued to strongly defend himself in his memoirs in 1955–1956, stating many lives could have been lost had the United States invaded mainland Japan without the atomic bombs. In 1963, he stood by his decision, telling a journalist ""it was done to save 125,000\xa0youngsters on the U.S. side and 125,000 on the Japanese side from getting killed and that is what it did. It probably also saved a half million youngsters on both sides from being maimed for life.""[154]', 'The end of World War II was followed by an uneasy transition from war to a peacetime economy. The costs of the war effort had been enormous, and Truman was intent on diminishing military services as quickly as possible to curtail the government\'s military expenditures. The effect of demobilization on the economy was unknown, proposals were met with skepticism and resistance, and fears existed that the nation would slide back into depression. In Roosevelt\'s final years, Congress began to reassert legislative power and Truman faced a congressional body where Republicans and conservative southern Democrats formed a powerful ""conservative coalition"" voting bloc. The New Deal had greatly strengthened labor unions and they formed a major base of support for Truman\'s Democratic Party. The Republicans, working with big business, made it their highest priority to weaken those unions.[155] The unions had been promoted by the government during the war and tried to make their gains permanent through large-scale strikes in major industries. Meanwhile, price controls were slowly ending, and inflation was soaring.[156] Truman\'s response to the widespread dissatisfaction was generally seen as ineffective.[156]', 'When a national rail strike threatened in May 1946, Truman seized the railroads in an attempt to contain the issue, but two key railway unions struck anyway. The entire national railroad system was shut down, immobilizing 24,000\xa0freight trains and 175,000\xa0passenger trains a day.[157] For two days, public anger mounted. His staff prepared a speech that Truman read to Congress calling for a new law, whereby railroad strikers would be drafted into the army. As he concluded his address, he was handed a note that the strike had been settled on presidential terms; nevertheless, a few hours later, the House voted to draft the strikers. The bill died in the Senate.[158][159]', 'The president\'s approval rating dropped from 82\xa0percent in the polls in January 1946 to 52\xa0percent by June.[160] This dissatisfaction led to large Democratic losses in the 1946 midterm elections, and Republicans took control of Congress for the first time since 1930. When Truman dropped to 32\xa0percent in the polls, Democratic Arkansas Senator William Fulbright suggested that Truman resign; the president said he did not care what Senator ""Halfbright"" said.[161][162]', ""Truman cooperated closely with the Republican leaders on foreign policy but fought them bitterly on domestic issues. The power of the labor unions was significantly curtailed by the Taft–Hartley Act which was enacted over Truman's veto. Truman twice vetoed bills to lower income tax rates in 1947. Although the initial vetoes were sustained, Congress overrode his veto of a tax cut bill in 1948. In one notable instance of bipartisanship, Congress passed the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, which replaced the secretary of state with the Speaker of the House and the president pro tempore of the Senate as successor to the president after the vice president.[163]"", 'As he readied for the 1948 election, Truman made clear his identity as a Democrat in the New Deal tradition, advocating for national health insurance,[164] and repeal of the Taft–Hartley Act. He broke with the New Deal by initiating an aggressive civil rights program which he termed a moral priority. His economic and social vision constituted a broad legislative agenda that came to be called the ""Fair Deal.""[165] Truman\'s proposals were not well received by Congress, even with renewed Democratic majorities in Congress after 1948. The Solid South rejected civil rights as those states still enforced segregation. Only one of the major Fair Deal bills, the Housing Act of 1949, was ever enacted.[166][167] Many of the New Deal programs that persisted during Truman\'s presidency have since received minor improvements and extensions.[168]', ""As a Wilsonian internationalist, Truman supported Roosevelt's policy in favor of the creation of the United Nations and included Eleanor Roosevelt on the delegation to the first UN General Assembly.[170] With the Soviet Union expanding its sphere of influence through Eastern Europe, Truman and his foreign policy advisors took a hard line against the USSR. In this, he matched U.S. public opinion which quickly came to believe the Soviets were intent upon world domination.[171]"", 'Although he had little personal expertise on foreign matters, Truman listened closely to his top advisors, especially George Marshall and Dean Acheson. The Republicans controlled Congress in 1947–1948, so he worked with their leaders, especially Senator Arthur H. Vandenburg, chairman of the powerful Foreign Relations Committee.[172] He won bipartisan support for both the Truman Doctrine, which formalized a policy of Soviet containment, and the Marshall Plan, which aimed to help rebuild postwar Europe.[173][174]', 'To get Congress to spend the vast sums necessary to restart the moribund European economy, Truman used an ideological argument, arguing that communism flourishes in economically deprived areas.[175] As part of the U.S. Cold War strategy, Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947 and reorganized military forces by merging the Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (later the Department of Defense) and creating the U.S. Air Force. The act also created the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the National Security Council.[176] On November 4, 1952, Truman authorized the official, though at the time, confidential creation of the National Security Agency (NSA).[177][178]', 'Truman did not know what to do about China, where the Nationalists and Communists were fighting a large-scale civil war. The Nationalists had been major wartime allies and had large-scale popular support in the United States, along with a powerful lobby. General George Marshall spent most of 1946 in China trying to negotiate a compromise but failed. He convinced Truman the Nationalists would never win on their own and a very large-scale U.S. intervention to stop the Communists would significantly weaken U.S. opposition to the Soviets in Europe. By 1949, the Communists under Mao Zedong had won the civil war, the United States had a new enemy in Asia, and Truman came under fire from conservatives for ""losing"" China.[179]', ""On June 24, 1948, the Soviet Union blocked access to the three Western-held sectors of Berlin. The Allies had not negotiated a deal to guarantee supply of the sectors deep within the Soviet-occupied zone. The commander of the U.S. occupation zone in Germany, General Lucius D. Clay, proposed sending a large armored column across the Soviet zone to West Berlin with instructions to defend itself if it were stopped or attacked. Truman believed this would entail an unacceptable risk of war. He approved Ernest Bevin's plan to supply the blockaded city by air."", ""On June 25, the Allies initiated the Berlin Airlift, a campaign to deliver food, coal and other supplies using military aircraft on a massive scale. Nothing like it had ever been attempted before, and no single nation had the capability, either logistically or materially, to accomplish it. The airlift worked; ground access was again granted on May 11, 1949. Nevertheless, the airlift continued for several months after that. The Berlin Airlift was one of Truman's great foreign policy successes; it significantly aided his election campaign in 1948.[180]"", 'Truman had long taken an interest in the history of the Middle East and was sympathetic to Jews who sought to re-establish their ancient homeland in Mandatory Palestine. As a senator, he announced support for Zionism; in 1943 he called for a homeland for those Jews who survived the Nazi regime. However, State Department officials were reluctant to offend the Arabs, who were opposed to the establishment of a Jewish state in the large region long populated and dominated culturally by Arabs. Secretary of Defense James Forrestal warned Truman of the importance of Saudi Arabian oil in another war; Truman replied he would decide his policy on the basis of justice, not oil.[181] U.S. diplomats with experience in the region were opposed, but Truman told them he had few Arabs among his constituents.[182]', 'Palestine was secondary to the goal of protecting the ""Northern Tier"" of Greece, Turkey, and Iran from communism, as promised by the Truman Doctrine.[183] Weary of both the convoluted politics of the Middle East and pressure by Jewish leaders, Truman was undecided on his policy and skeptical about how the Jewish ""underdogs"" would handle power.[184][185] He later cited as decisive in his recognition of the Jewish state the advice of his former business partner, Eddie Jacobson, a non-religious Jew whom Truman absolutely trusted.[182]', 'Truman decided to recognize Israel over the objections of Secretary of State George Marshall, who feared it would hurt relations with the populous Arab states. Marshall believed the paramount threat to the United States was the Soviet Union and feared Arab oil would be lost to the United States in the event of war; he warned Truman the United States was ""playing with fire with nothing to put it out"".[186] Truman recognized the State of Israel on May 14, 1948, eleven minutes after it declared itself a nation.[187][188] Of his decision to recognize the Israeli state, Truman said in an interview years later: ""Hitler had been murdering Jews right and left. I saw it, and I dream about it even to this day. The Jews needed some place where they could go. It is my attitude that the American government couldn\'t stand idly by while the victims [of] Hitler\'s madness are not allowed to build new lives.""[189]', 'Under his predecessor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Fair Employment Practices Committee was created to address racial discrimination in employment,[190] and in 1946, Truman created the President\'s Committee on Civil Rights. On June 29, 1947, Truman became the first president to address the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). The speech took place at the Lincoln Memorial during the NAACP convention and was carried nationally on radio. In that speech, Truman laid out the need to end discrimination, which would be advanced by the first comprehensive, presidentially proposed civil rights legislation. Truman on ""civil rights and human freedom"", declared:[191]', ""It is my deep conviction that we have reached a turning point in the long history of our country's efforts to guarantee freedom and equality to all our citizens … it is more important today than ever before to ensure that all Americans enjoy these rights. … When I say all Americans, I mean all Americans … Our immediate task is to remove the last remnants of the barriers which stand between millions of our citizens and their birthright. There is no justifiable reason for discrimination because of ancestry, or religion, or race, or color. We must not tolerate such limitations on the freedom of any of our people and on their enjoyment of basic rights which every citizen in a truly democratic society must possess. Every man should have the right to a decent home, the right to an education, the right to adequate medical care, the right to a worthwhile job, the right to an equal share in making the public decisions through the ballot, and the right to a fair trial in a fair court. We must ensure that these rights – on equal terms – are enjoyed by every citizen. To these principles I pledge my full and continued support. Many of our people still suffer the indignity of insult, the harrowing fear of intimidation, and, I regret to say, the threat of physical injury and mob violence. Prejudice and intolerance in which these evils are rooted still exist. The conscience of our nation, and the legal machinery which enforces it, have not yet secured to each citizen full freedom from fear."", 'In February 1948, Truman delivered a formal message to Congress requesting adoption of his 10-point program to secure civil rights, including anti-lynching, voter rights, and elimination of segregation. ""No political act since the Compromise of 1877,"" argued biographer Taylor Branch, ""so profoundly influenced race relations; in a sense it was a repeal of 1877.""[192]', 'The 1948 presidential election is remembered for Truman\'s stunning come-from-behind victory.[193] In the spring of 1948, Truman\'s public approval rating stood at 36\xa0percent,[194] and the president was nearly universally regarded as incapable of winning the general election. At the 1948 Democratic National Convention, Truman attempted to unify the party with a vague civil rights plank in the party platform. His intention was to assuage the internal conflicts between the northern and southern wings of his party. Events overtook his efforts. A sharp address given by Mayor Hubert Humphrey of Minneapolis—as well as the local political interests of a number of urban bosses—convinced the convention to adopt a stronger civil rights plank, which Truman approved wholeheartedly.[195] Truman delivered an aggressive acceptance speech attacking the 80th Congress, which Truman called the ""Do Nothing Congress,""[156] and promising to win the election and ""make these Republicans like it.""[196]', ""Republicans approve of the American farmer, but they are willing to help him go broke. They stand four-square for the American home—but not for housing. They are strong for labor—but they are stronger for restricting labor's rights. They favor minimum wage—the smaller the minimum wage the better. They endorse educational opportunity for all—but they won't spend money for teachers or for schools. They think modern medical care and hospitals are fine—for people who can afford them\xa0... They think American standard of living is a fine thing—so long as it doesn't spread to all the people. And they admire the Government of the United States so much that they would like to buy it."", 'Within two weeks of the 1948 convention Truman issued Executive Order 9981, ending racial discrimination in the Armed Services, and Executive Order 9980 to end discrimination in federal agencies.[200][201] Truman took a considerable political risk in backing civil rights, and many seasoned Democrats were concerned the loss of Dixiecrat support might seriously weaken the party. South Carolina Governor Strom Thurmond, a segregationist, declared his candidacy for the presidency on a Dixiecrat ticket and led a full-scale revolt of Southern ""states\' rights"" proponents. This rebellion on the right was matched by one on the left, led by Wallace on the Progressive Party ticket. The Democratic Party was splitting three ways and victory in November seemed unlikely.[202] For his running mate, Truman accepted Kentucky Senator Alben W. Barkley, though he really wanted Justice William O. Douglas, who turned down the nomination.[203]', 'Truman\'s political advisors described the political scene as ""one unholy, confusing cacophony."" They told Truman to speak directly to the people, in a personal way.[204] Campaign manager William J. Bray said Truman took this advice, and spoke personally and passionately, sometimes even setting aside his notes to talk to Americans ""of everything that is in my heart and soul.""[205]', 'The campaign was a 21,928-mile (35,290\xa0km) presidential odyssey.[206] In a personal appeal to the nation, Truman crisscrossed the United States by train; his ""whistle stop"" speeches from the rear platform of the presidential car, Ferdinand Magellan, came to represent his campaign. His combative appearances captured the popular imagination and drew huge crowds. Six stops in Michigan drew a combined half-million people;[207] a full million turned out for a New York City ticker-tape parade.[208]', ""The large crowds at Truman's whistle-stop events were an important sign of a change in momentum in the campaign, but this shift went virtually unnoticed by the national press corps. It continued reporting Republican Thomas Dewey's apparent impending victory as a certainty. The three major polling organizations stopped polling well before the November 2 election date—Roper in September, and Crossley and Gallup in October—thus failing to measure the period when Truman appears to have surged past Dewey.[209][210]"", 'In the end, Truman held his progressive Midwestern base, won most of the Southern states despite the civil rights plank, and squeaked through with narrow victories in a few critical states, notably Ohio, California, and Illinois. The final tally showed the president had secured 303\xa0electoral votes, Dewey\xa0189, and Thurmond only 39. Henry Wallace got none. The defining image of the campaign came after Election Day, when an ecstatic Truman held aloft the erroneous front page of the Chicago Tribune with a huge headline proclaiming ""Dewey Defeats Truman.""[211]', ""Truman's second inauguration on January 20, 1949, was the first ever televised nationally.[212]"", ""The Soviet Union's atomic bomb project progressed much faster than had been expected,[213] and they detonated their first bomb on August 29, 1949. Over the next several months there was an intense debate that split the U.S. government, military, and scientific communities regarding whether to proceed with the development of the far more powerful hydrogen bomb.[214] The debate touched on matters from technical feasibility to strategic value to the morality of creating a massively destructive weapon.[215][216] On January 31, 1950, Truman made the decision to go forward on the grounds that if the Soviets could make an H-bomb, the United States must do so as well and stay ahead in the nuclear arms race.[217][218] The development achieved fruition with the first U.S. H-bomb test on October 31, 1952, which was officially announced by Truman on January 7, 1953.[219]"", 'On June 25, 1950, the North Korean army under Kim Il-sung invaded South Korea, starting the Korean War. In the early weeks of the war, the North Koreans easily pushed back their southern counterparts.[220] Truman called for a naval blockade of Korea, only to learn that due to budget cutbacks, the U.S. Navy could not enforce such a measure.[221]', 'Truman promptly urged the United Nations to intervene; it did, authorizing troops under the UN flag led by U.S. General Douglas MacArthur. Truman decided he did not need formal authorization from Congress, believing that most legislators supported his position; this would come back to haunt him later when the stalemated conflict was dubbed ""Mr. Truman\'s War"" by legislators.[220] Rockoff writes that ""President Truman responded quickly to the June invasion by authorizing the use of U.S. troops and ordering air strikes and a naval blockade. He did not, however, seek a declaration of war, or call for full mobilization, in part because such actions might have been misinterpreted by Russia and China. Instead, on July 19 he called for partial mobilization and asked Congress for an appropriation of $10 billion for the war.""[222] Cohen writes that: ""All of Truman\'s advisers saw the events in Korea as a test of American will to resist Soviet attempts to expand their power, and their system. The United States ordered warships to the Taiwan Strait to prevent Mao\'s forces from invading Taiwan and mopping up the remnants of Chiang Kai-shek\'s army there.""[223]', 'However, on July 3, 1950, Truman did give Senate Majority Leader Scott W. Lucas a draft resolution titled ""Joint Resolution Expressing Approval of the Action Taken in Korea"". Lucas stated Congress supported the use of force, the formal resolution would pass but was unnecessary, and the consensus in Congress was to acquiesce. Truman responded he did not want ""to appear to be trying to get around Congress and use extra-Constitutional powers,"" and added that it was ""up to Congress whether such a resolution should be introduced.""[224]', 'By August 1950, U.S. troops pouring into South Korea under UN auspices were able to stabilize the situation.[225] Responding to criticism over readiness, Truman fired his secretary of defense, Louis A. Johnson, replacing him with the retired General Marshall. With UN approval, Truman decided on a ""rollback"" policy—liberation of North Korea.[226] UN forces led by General Douglas MacArthur led the counterattack, scoring a stunning surprise victory with an amphibious landing at the Battle of Inchon that nearly trapped the invaders. UN forces marched north, toward the Yalu River boundary with China, with the goal of reuniting Korea under UN auspices.[227]', ""China surprised the UN forces with a large-scale invasion in November. The UN forces were forced back to below the 38th parallel, then recovered.[228] By early 1951 the war became a fierce stalemate at about the 38th parallel where it had begun. Truman rejected MacArthur's request to attack Chinese supply bases north of Yalu, but MacArthur promoted his plan to Republican House leader Joseph Martin, who leaked it to the press. Truman was gravely concerned further escalation of the war might lead to open conflict with the Soviet Union, which was already supplying weapons and providing warplanes (with Korean markings and Soviet aircrew). Therefore, on April 11, 1951, Truman fired MacArthur from his commands.[229]"", ""I fired him [MacArthur] because he wouldn't respect the authority of the President\xa0... I didn't fire him because he was a dumb son of a bitch, although he was, but that's not against the law for generals. If it was, half to three-quarters of them would be in jail.[230]"", 'The dismissal of General Douglas MacArthur was among the least politically popular decisions in presidential history. Truman\'s approval ratings plummeted, and he faced calls for his impeachment from, among others, Senator Robert A. Taft.[231] Fierce criticism from virtually all quarters accused Truman of refusing to shoulder the blame for a war gone sour and blaming his generals instead. Others, including Eleanor Roosevelt and all of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, publicly supported Truman\'s decision. MacArthur meanwhile returned to the United States to a hero\'s welcome, and addressed a joint session of Congress, a speech the president called ""a bunch of damn bullshit.""[232]', 'Truman and his generals considered the use of nuclear weapons against the Chinese army, but ultimately chose not to escalate the war to a nuclear level.[233] The war remained a frustrating stalemate for two years, with over 30,000 Americans killed, until an armistice ended the fighting in 1953.[citation needed]', ""In February 1952, Truman's approval mark stood at 22 percent according to Gallup polls, which is the all-time lowest approval mark for a sitting U.S. president, though it was matched by Richard Nixon in 1974.[234][235]"", ""The escalation of the Cold War was highlighted by Truman's approval of NSC 68, a secret statement of foreign policy. It called for tripling the defense budget, and the globalization and militarization of containment policy whereby the United States and its NATO allies would respond militarily to actual Soviet expansion. The document was drafted by Paul Nitze, who consulted State and Defense officials and was formally approved by President Truman as the official national strategy after the war began in Korea. It called for partial mobilization of the U.S. economy to build armaments faster than the Soviets. The plan called for strengthening Europe, weakening the Soviet Union, and building up the United States both militarily and economically.[236]"", ""Truman was a strong supporter of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which established a formal peacetime military alliance with Canada and democratic European nations of the Western Bloc following World War II. The treaty establishing it was widely popular and easily passed the Senate in 1949; Truman appointed General Dwight D. Eisenhower as commander. NATO's goals were to contain Soviet expansion in Europe and to send a clear message to communist leaders that the world's democracies were willing and able to build new security structures in support of democratic ideals. The United States, Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark, Portugal, Iceland, and Canada were the original treaty signatories. The alliance resulted in the Soviets establishing a similar alliance, called the Warsaw Pact.[237][238]"", ""General Marshall was Truman's principal adviser on foreign policy matters, influencing such decisions as the U.S. choice against offering direct military aid to Chiang Kai-shek and his nationalist Chinese forces in the Chinese Civil War against their communist opponents. Marshall's opinion was contrary to the counsel of almost all of Truman's other advisers; Marshall thought propping up Chiang's forces would drain U.S. resources necessary for Europe to deter the Soviets.[239] When the communists took control of the mainland, establishing the People's Republic of China and driving the nationalists to Taiwan, Truman would have been willing to maintain some relationship between the United States and the new government, but Mao was unwilling.[240] Truman announced on January 5, 1950, that the United States would not engage in any dispute involving the Taiwan Strait, and that he would not intervene in the event of an attack by the PRC.[241]"", ""On June 27, 1950, after the outbreak of fighting in Korea, Truman ordered the U.S. Navy's Seventh Fleet into the Taiwan Strait to prevent further conflict between the communist government on the China mainland and the Republic of China (ROC) in Taiwan.[242][243]"", 'Truman usually worked well with his top staff – the exceptions were Israel in 1948 and Spain in 1945–1950. Truman was a very strong opponent of Francisco Franco, the right-wing dictator of Spain. He withdrew the American ambassador (but diplomatic relations were not formally broken), kept Spain out of the UN, and rejected any Marshall Plan financial aid to Spain. However, as the Cold War escalated, support for Spain was strong in Congress, the Pentagon, the business community and other influential elements especially Catholics and cotton growers.', 'Liberal opposition to Spain had faded after the Wallace element broke with the Democratic Party in 1948; the CIO became passive on the issue. As Secretary of State Acheson increased his pressure on Truman, the president stood alone in his administration as his own top appointees wanted to normalize relations. When China entered the Korean War and pushed American forces back, the argument for allies became irresistible. Admitting he was ""overruled and worn down,"" Truman relented and sent an ambassador and made loans available.[244]', 'In August 1948, Whittaker Chambers, a former spy for the Soviets and a senior editor at Time magazine, testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). He said an underground communist network had worked inside the U.S. government during the 1930s, of which Chambers had been a member, along with Alger Hiss, until recently a senior State Department official. Chambers did not allege any spying during the Truman presidency. Although Hiss denied the allegations, he was convicted in January 1950 for perjury for denials under oath.', 'The Soviet Union\'s success in exploding an atomic weapon in 1949 and the fall of the nationalist Chinese the same year led many Americans to conclude subversion by Soviet spies was responsible and to demand that communists be rooted out from the government and other places of influence.[245][246] Hoping to contain these fears, Truman began a ""loyalty program"" with Executive Order 9835 in 1947.[247] However, Truman got himself into deeper trouble when he called the Hiss trial a ""red herring"".[248][249] Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy accused the State Department of harboring communists and rode the controversy to political fame,[250] leading to the Second Red Scare,[251] also known as McCarthyism. McCarthy\'s stifling accusations made it difficult to speak out against him. This led Truman to call McCarthy ""the greatest asset the Kremlin has"" by ""torpedo[ing] the bipartisan foreign policy of the United States.""[252]', 'Charges that Soviet agents had infiltrated the government were believed by 78\xa0percent of the people in 1946 and became a major campaign issue for Eisenhower in 1952.[253] Truman was reluctant to take a more radical stance, because he felt it could threaten civil liberties and add to a potential hysteria. At the same time, he felt political pressure to indicate a strong national security.[254] It is unclear to what extent President Truman was briefed of the Venona intercepts, which discovered widespread evidence of Soviet espionage on the atom bomb project and afterward.[255][256] Truman continued his own loyalty program for some time while believing the issue of communist espionage was overstated.[255] In 1949, Truman described American communist leaders, whom his administration was prosecuting, as ""traitors"".[254] Truman would later state in private conversations with friends that his creation of a loyalty program had been a ""terrible"" mistake.[257]', 'In 1950, Truman vetoed the McCarran Internal Security Act, which was passed by Congress just after the start of the Korean War and was aimed at controlling communists in America.[258] Truman called the Act, ""the greatest danger to freedom of speech, press, and assembly since the Alien and Sedition Laws of 1798,"" a ""mockery of the Bill of Rights"" and a ""long step toward totalitarianism"".[259][260] His veto was immediately overridden by Congress and the Act became law.[258] In the mid-1960s, parts of the Act were found to be unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court.[261][262]', ""In 1948, Truman ordered an addition to the exterior of the White House: a second-floor balcony in the south portico, which came to be known as the Truman Balcony. The addition was unpopular.

Architectural and engineering investigations during 1948 deemed it unsafe for occupancy. Truman, his family, and the entire residence staff were relocated across the street into Blair House during the renovations.

Collazo was wounded and stopped before he entered the house. He was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death in 1952. Truman commuted his sentence to life in prison. To try to settle the question of Puerto Rican independence, Truman allowed a plebiscite in Puerto Rico in 1952 to determine the status of its relationship to the United States.

The Supreme Court found Truman's actions unconstitutional, however, and reversed the order in a major separation-of-powers decision, Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer (1952). The 6–3\xa0decision, which held that Truman's assertion of authority was too vague and was not rooted in any legislative action by Congress, was delivered by a court composed entirely of justices appointed by either Truman or Roosevelt.

Howard McGrath fired the special prosecutor in early 1952 for being too zealous, Truman fired McGrath.[270] Truman submitted a reorganization plan to reform the IRB; Congress passed it, but corruption was a major issue in the 1952 presidential election.[271][272]', ""On December 6, 1950, Washington Post music critic Paul Hume wrote a critical review of a concert by the president's daughter Margaret Truman:"", 'Miss Truman is a unique American phenomenon with a pleasant voice of little size and fair quality\xa0... [she] cannot sing very well\xa0... is flat a good deal of the time—more last night than at any time we have heard her in past years\xa0... has not improved in the years we have heard her\xa0... [and] still cannot sing with anything approaching professional finish.[273]', 'Truman wrote a scathing response:', ""I've just read your lousy review of Margaret's concert. I've come to the conclusion that you are an 'eight ulcer man on four ulcer pay.' It seems to me that you are a frustrated old man who wishes he could have been successful. When you write such poppy-cock as was in the back section of the paper you work for it shows conclusively that you're off the beam and at least four of your ulcers are at work. Some day I hope to meet you. When that happens you'll need a new nose, a lot of beefsteak for black eyes, and perhaps a supporter below! Pegler, a gutter snipe, is a gentleman alongside you. I hope you'll accept that statement as a worse insult than a reflection on your ancestry.[273]"", 'Truman was criticized by many for the letter. However, he pointed out that he wrote it as a loving father and not as the president.[274][275][276]', ""In 1951, William M. Boyle, Truman's longtime friend and chairman of the Democratic National Committee, was forced to resign after being charged with financial corruption.[277]"", 'A 1947 report by the Truman administration titled To Secure These Rights presented a detailed ten-point agenda of civil rights reforms. Speaking about this report, international developments have to be taken into account, for with the UN Charter being passed in 1945, the question of whether international human rights law could be applicable also on an inner-land basis became crucial in the United States. Though the report acknowledged such a path was not free from controversy in the 1940s United States, it nevertheless raised the possibility for the UN-Charter to be used as a legal tool to combat racial discrimination in the United States.[278]', 'In February 1948, the president submitted a civil rights agenda to Congress that proposed creating several federal offices devoted to issues such as voting rights and fair employment practices.[279] This provoked a storm of criticism from southern Democrats in the runup to the national nominating convention, but Truman refused to compromise, saying: ""My forebears were Confederates\xa0... but my very stomach turned over when I had learned that Negro soldiers, just back from overseas, were being dumped out of Army trucks in Mississippi and beaten.""[280]', 'Tales of the abuse, violence, and persecution suffered by many African American veterans upon their return from World War II infuriated Truman and were major factors in his decision to issue Executive Order 9981, in July 1948, requiring equal opportunity in the armed forces.[281] In the early 1950s after several years of planning, recommendations and revisions between Truman, the Committee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity and the various branches of the military, the services became racially integrated.[282] Truman later appointed people who aligned with his civil rights agenda. He appointed fellow colonel and civil rights icon Blake R. Van Leer to the board of the United States Naval Academy and UNESCO who had a focus to work against racism through influential statements on race.[283][284] Truman made a historic move in 1949, when he gave a recess appointment to William H. Hastie for the Court of Appeals, the first African-American federal judge in the United States.[285]', 'Executive Order 9980, also in 1948, made it illegal to discriminate against persons applying for civil service positions based on race. A third, in 1951, established the Committee on Government Contract Compliance, which ensured defense contractors did not discriminate because of race.[286][287]', 'From 1947 until 1989, world affairs were dominated by the Cold War, in which the U.S. and its allies faced the Soviet Union and its allies. There was no large-scale fighting but instead several local civil wars as well as the ever-present threat of a catastrophic nuclear war.[288][289]', ""Unlike Roosevelt, Truman distrusted Stalin and the Soviet Union, and did not have FDR's faith in the UN to soften major tensions. Nevertheless, he cooperated in terms of dividing control over Germany. Soviet efforts to use its army to control politics in Eastern Europe and Iran angered Washington. The final break came in 1947 when the Labour government in London could no longer afford to help Greece fight communism and asked Washington to assume responsibility for suppressing the Communist uprising there.[290][291] The result was the Truman Doctrine of 1947–48 which made it national policy to contain Communist expansion.[292]"", ""Truman was supported by the great majority of Democrats, after he forced out the Henry Wallace faction that wanted good terms with Moscow.[293] Truman's policy had the strong support of most Republicans, who led by Senator Arthur Vandenberg overcame the isolationist Republicans led by Senator Robert A. Taft.[294]"", 'In 1948, Truman signed the Marshall Plan, which supplied Western Europe—including Germany—with US$13\xa0billion in reconstruction aid. Stalin vetoed any participation by East European nations. A similar program was operated by the United States to restore the Japanese economy. The U.S. actively sought allies, which it subsidized with military and economic ""foreign aid"", as well as diplomatic support. The main diplomatic initiative was the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949, committing the United States to nuclear defense of Western Europe. The result was a peace in Europe, coupled with the fear of Soviet invasion and a reliance on American protection.[295] The United States operated a worldwide network of bases for its Army, Navy and Air Force, with large contingents stationed in Germany, Japan and South Korea.[296] Washington had a weak intelligence community before 1942, and the Soviets had a very effective network of spies. The solution was to create the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in 1947.[297] Economic and propaganda warfare against the communist world became part of the American toolbox.[298]', ""The containment policy was developed by State Department official George Kennan in 1947.[299] Kennan characterized the Soviet Union as an aggressive, anti-Western power that necessitated containment, a characterization which would shape US foreign policy for decades to come. The idea of containment was to match Soviet aggression with force wherever it occurred while not using nuclear weapons. The policy of containment created a bipolar, zero-sum world where the ideological conflicts between the Soviet Union and the United States dominated geopolitics. Due to the antagonism on both sides and each countries' search for security, a tense worldwide contest developed between the two states as the two nations' governments vied for global supremacy militarily, culturally, and politically.[300]"", ""The Cold War was characterized by a lack of global hot wars. Instead there were proxy wars, fought by client states and proxies of the United States and Soviet Union. The most important was Korean War (1950–1953), a stalemate that drained away Truman's base of support. Truman made five international trips during his presidency.[301]"", ""In 1951, the United States ratified the 22nd Amendment, making a president ineligible for election to a third term or for election to a second full term after serving more than two remaining years of a term of a previously elected president. The latter clause did not apply to Truman's situation in 1952 because of a grandfather clause exempting the incumbent president.[302]"", ""Therefore, he seriously considered running for another term in 1952 and left his name on the ballot in the New Hampshire primary. However, all his close advisors, pointing to his age, his failing abilities, and his poor showing in the polls, talked him out of it.[303] At the time of the 1952 New Hampshire primary (March 11, 1952), no candidate had won Truman's backing. His first choice, Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson, had declined to run. Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson had also turned Truman down, Vice President Barkley was considered too old,[304][305] and Truman distrusted and disliked Senator Kefauver, who had made a name for himself by his investigations of the Truman administration scandals."", 'Truman let his name be entered in the New Hampshire primary by supporters. The highly unpopular Truman was handily defeated by Kefauver; 18\xa0days later the president formally announced he would not seek a second full term. Truman was eventually able to persuade Stevenson to run, and the governor gained the nomination at the 1952 Democratic National Convention.[306]', 'Eisenhower gained the Republican nomination, with Senator Nixon as his running mate, and campaigned against what he denounced as Truman\'s failures: ""Korea, communism and corruption"". He pledged to clean up the ""mess in Washington,"" and promised to ""go to Korea.""[304][305] Eisenhower defeated Stevenson decisively in the general election, ending 20\xa0years of Democratic presidents. While Truman and Eisenhower had previously been on good terms, Truman felt annoyed that Eisenhower did not denounce Joseph McCarthy during the campaign.[307] Similarly, Eisenhower was outraged when Truman accused the former general of disregarding ""sinister forces\xa0... Anti-Semitism, anti-Catholicism, and anti-foreignism"" within the Republican Party.[308]', ""Before being elected as Jackson County judge, Truman had earned little money, and was in debt from the failure of his haberdashery. His election as senator in 1934 carried with it a salary of $10,000 (equivalent to $228,000 in 2023), high for the time, but the need to maintain two homes, with one in expensive Washington, Margaret Truman's college expenses, and contributions to the support of needy relatives, left the Trumans little extra money. He likely had around $7,500 (equivalent to $127,000 in 2023) in cash and government bonds when nominated for vice president.[309]"", 'His finances were transformed by his accession to the presidency, which carried with it a salary of $75,000 (equivalent to $1,269,000 in 2023), which was increased to $100,000 (equivalent to $1,281,000 in 2023) in 1949. This was a higher salary than any Major League Baseball star, except Joe DiMaggio, who also earned $100,000 in his final two seasons (1950 and 1951). Beginning in 1949, the president was also granted a $50,000 (equivalent to $640,000 in 2023) expense allowance, which was initially tax-free, and did not have to be accounted for. Although the allowance became taxable later in his presidency, Truman never reported it on his tax return, and converted some of the funds to cash he kept in the White House safe and later in a safe deposit box in Kansas City.[309]', 'Upon leaving the presidency, Truman returned to Independence, Missouri, to live at the Wallace home he and Bess had shared for years with her mother.[310] In a biography that contributed greatly to the myth that Truman was near penury after departing the White House,[309] David McCullough stated that the Trumans had little alternative than to return to Independence, for his only income was his army pension of $112.56 per month (equivalent to $1,282 in 2023), and he had only been able to save a modest amount from his salary as president.[311] In February 1953, Truman signed a book deal for his memoirs, and in a draft will dated December of that year listed land worth $250,000 (equivalent to $2,847,000 in 2023), savings bonds of the same amount, and cash of $150,000 (equivalent to $1,708,000 in 2023).[309] He wrote, ""Bonds, land, and cash all come from savings of presidential salary and free expense account. It should keep you and Margaret comfortably.""[309]', 'The writing of the memoirs was a struggle for Truman, and he went through a dozen collaborators during the project,[312] not all of whom served him well,[313] but he remained heavily involved in the result.[314] For the memoirs, Truman received a payment of $670,000 (equivalent to $7,620,522 in 2023).[315] The memoirs were a commercial and critical success.[316][317] They were published in two volumes: Memoirs by Harry S. Truman: Year of Decisions (1955) and Memoirs by Harry S. Truman: Years of Trial and Hope (1956).[318][319]', 'Former members of Congress and the federal courts received a federal retirement package; President Truman himself ensured that former servants of the executive branch of government received similar support. In 1953, however, there was no such benefit package for former presidents, and Congressional pensions were not approved until 1946, after Truman had left the Senate, so he received no pension for his Senate service.[320] Truman, behind the scenes, lobbied for a pension, writing to congressional leaders that he had been near penury but for the sale of family farmlands, and in February 1958, in the first televised interview of a former US president that aired on CBS, Truman claimed that ""If I hadn\'t inherited some property that finally paid things through, I\'d be on relief right now.""[309] That year, Congress passed the Former Presidents Act, offering a $25,000 (equivalent to $264,014 in 2023) yearly pension to each former president, and it is likely that Truman\'s claim to be in difficult financial straits played a role in the law\'s enactment.[321] The only other living former president at the time, Herbert Hoover, also took the pension, even though he did not need the money; reportedly, he did so to avoid embarrassing Truman.[322]', ""Truman's net worth improved further in 1958 when he and his siblings sold most of the family farm to a Kansas City real estate developer.[323] When he was serving as a county judge, Truman borrowed $31,000 (equivalent to $353,030 in 2023) by mortgaging the farm to the county school fund, which was legal at the time.[323] When Republicans controlled the court in 1940, they foreclosed in an effort to embarrass Truman politically, and his mother and sister Mary Jane had to vacate the home.[323] In 1945, Truman organized a syndicate of supporters who purchased the farm with the understanding that they would sell it back to the Trumans.[323] Harry and Vivian Truman purchased 87 acres in 1945, and Truman purchased another portion in 1946.[323] In January 1959, Truman calculated his net worth as $1,046,788.86 (equivalent to $10,941,000 in 2023), including a share in the Los Angeles Rams football team. Nevertheless, the Trumans always lived modestly in Independence, and when Bess Truman died in 1982, almost a decade after her husband, the house was found to be in poor condition due to deferred maintenance.[309]"", 'Bess Truman\'s personal papers were made public in 2009,[324] including financial records and tax returns. The myth that Truman had been in straitened circumstances after his presidency was slow to dissipate; Paul Campos wrote in 2021, ""The current, 20,000-plus-word Wikipedia biography of Truman goes so far as to assert that, because his earlier business ventures had failed, Truman left the White House with \'no personal savings.\' Every aspect of this narrative is false.""[309][g]', ""Truman's predecessor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, had organized his own presidential library, but legislation to enable future presidents to do something similar had not been enacted. Truman worked to garner private donations to build a presidential library, which he donated to the federal government to maintain and operate—a practice adopted by his successors.[325]"", 'He testified before Congress to have money appropriated to have presidential papers copied and organized. He was proud of the bill\'s passage in 1957. Max Skidmore, in his book on the life of former presidents, wrote that Truman was a well-read man, especially in history. Skidmore added that the presidential papers legislation and the founding of his library ""was the culmination of his interest in history. Together they constitute an enormous contribution to the United States—one of the greatest of any former president.""[326]', 'Truman taught occasional courses at universities, including Yale, where he was a Chubb Fellow visiting lecturer in 1958.[327] In 1962, Truman was a visiting lecturer at Canisius College.[328]', ""Truman supported Adlai Stevenson's second bid for the White House in 1956, although he had initially favored Democratic governor W. Averell Harriman of New York.[329] He continued to campaign for Democratic senatorial candidates for many years.[330]"", ""In 1960 Truman gave a public statement announcing he would not attend the Democratic Convention that year, citing concerns about the way that the supporters of John F. Kennedy had gained control of the nominating process, and called on Kennedy to forgo the nomination for that year.[331] Kennedy responded with a press conference where he bluntly rebuffed Truman's advice.[332]"", 'Despite his supportive stance on civil rights during his presidency, Truman expressed criticism of the civil rights movement during the 1960s. In 1960, he stated that he believed the sit-in movement to be part of a Soviet plot.[333] Truman\'s statement garnered a response from Martin Luther King Jr., who wrote a letter to the former president stating that he was ""baffled"" by the accusation, and demanded a public apology.[334] Truman would later criticize King following the Selma march in 1965, believing the protest to be ""silly"" and claiming that it ""can\'t accomplish a darn thing except to attract attention.""[335] In 1963, Truman voiced his opposition to interracial marriage, believing that daughters of white people would never love someone of an opposite color.[336][337]', ""On December 22, 1963, Truman published an article in The Washington Post entitled ‘Limit CIA Role to Intelligence' where he said that “for some time I have been disturbed by the way CIA has been diverted from its original assignment. It has become an operational and at times a policy-making arm of the Government” and that he “never had any thought that when I set up the CIA that it would be injected into peacetime cloak and dagger operations”. He concluded that “there is something about the way the CIA has been functioning that is casting a shadow over our historic position and I feel that we need to correct it”.[338]"", 'Upon turning 80 in 1964, Truman was feted in Washington, and addressed the Senate, availing himself of a new rule that allowed former presidents to be granted privilege of the floor.[339]', ""After a fall in his home in late 1964, Truman's physical condition declined. In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Medicare bill at the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum and gave the first two Medicare cards to Truman and his wife Bess to honor the former president's fight for government health care while in office.[330]"", ""On December 5, 1972, Truman was admitted to Kansas City's Research Hospital and Medical Center with pneumonia. He developed multiple organ failure, fell into a coma, and died at 7:50\xa0a.m. on December 26, at the age of 88. At the time of his death, Truman had been the oldest living president, a distinction he held from the time of Hoover's death in 1964.[340][310]"", 'Bess Truman opted for a simple private service at the library rather than a state funeral in Washington. A week after the funeral, foreign dignitaries and Washington officials attended a memorial service at Washington National Cathedral.[341]', 'Bess Truman died in 1982 and was buried next to her husband at the Harry S. Truman Library and Museum in Independence, Missouri.[342][343]', 'When he left office in 1953, Truman was one of the most unpopular chief executives in history. His job approval rating of 22% in the Gallup Poll of February 1952 was lower than Richard Nixon\'s 24% in August 1974, the month that Nixon resigned. American public feeling towards Truman grew steadily warmer with the passing years; as early as 1962, a poll of 75 historians conducted by Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr. ranked Truman among the ""near great"" presidents. The period following his death consolidated a partial rehabilitation of his legacy among both historians and members of the public.[344] Truman died when the nation was consumed with crises in Vietnam and Watergate, and his death brought a new wave of attention to his political career.[230] In the early and mid-1970s, Truman captured the popular imagination much as he had in 1948, this time emerging as a kind of political folk hero, a president who was thought to exemplify an integrity and accountability many observers felt was lacking in the Nixon White House. This public reassessment of Truman was aided by the popularity of a book of reminiscences which Truman had told to journalist Merle Miller beginning in 1961, with the agreement that they would not be published until after Truman\'s death.[345]', 'Truman had his latter-day critics as well. After a review of information available to Truman about the presence of espionage activities in the U.S. government, Democratic Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan concluded that Truman was ""almost willfully obtuse"" concerning the danger of American communism.[346] In 2010, historian Alonzo Hamby concluded that ""Harry Truman remains a controversial president.""[347] However, Truman has fared well in polls ranking the presidents, consistently being listed in the top ten;[348] this includes a 2022 poll by the Siena College Research Institute, which placed him in seventh.[349]', 'The fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 caused Truman advocates to claim vindication for Truman\'s decisions in the postwar period. According to Truman biographer Robert Dallek, ""His contribution to victory in the cold war without a devastating nuclear conflict elevated him to the stature of a great or near-great president.""[350] The 1992 publication of David McCollough\'s favorable biography of Truman further cemented the view of Truman as a highly regarded chief executive.[350] According to historian Daniel R. McCoy in his book on the Truman presidency:', 'Harry Truman himself gave a strong and far-from-incorrect impression of being a tough, concerned and direct leader.  He was occasionally vulgar, often partisan, and usually nationalistic\xa0... On his own terms, Truman can be seen as having prevented the coming of a third world war and having preserved from Communist oppression much of what he called the free world.  Yet clearly he largely failed to achieve his Wilsonian aim of securing perpetual peace, making the world safe for democracy, and advancing opportunities for individual development internationally.[351]', 'In 1956, Truman traveled to Europe with his wife. In Britain, he received an honorary degree in Civic Law from Oxford University and met with Winston Churchill.[329] In 1959, he was given a 50-year award by the Masons, recognizing his longstanding involvement: he was initiated on February 9, 1909, into the Belton Freemasonry Lodge in Missouri. In 1911, he helped establish the Grandview Lodge, and he served as its first Worshipful Master. In September 1940, during his Senate re-election campaign, Truman was elected Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Missouri; Truman said later that the Masonic election assured his victory in the general election.

Charles_de_Gaulle,"['Charles André Joseph Marie de Gaulle[a][b] (22 November 1890\xa0– 9 November 1970) was a French military officer and statesman who led the Free French Forces against Nazi Germany in World War II and chaired the Provisional Government of the French Republic from 1944 to 1946 to restore democracy in France. In 1958, amid the Algerian War, he came out of retirement when appointed Prime Minister by President René Coty. He rewrote the Constitution of France and founded the Fifth Republic after approval by referendum. He was elected President of France later that year, a position he held until his resignation in 1969.', ""Born in Lille, he was a decorated officer of the First World War, wounded several times and taken prisoner by the Germans. During the interwar period, he advocated mobile armoured divisions. During the German invasion of May 1940, he led an armoured division that counterattacked the invaders; he was then appointed Undersecretary for War. Refusing to accept his government's armistice with Germany, De Gaulle fled to England and exhorted the French to continue the fight in his Appeal of 18 June. He led the Free French Forces and later headed the French National Liberation Committee and emerged as the undisputed leader of Free France. He became head of the Provisional Government of the French Republic in June 1944, the interim government of France following its liberation. As early as 1944, De Gaulle introduced a dirigiste economic policy, which included substantial state-directed control over a capitalist economy, which was followed by 30 years of unprecedented growth, known as the Trente Glorieuses. He resigned in 1946, but continued to be politically active as founder of the Rally of the French People. He retired in the early 1950s and wrote his War Memoirs, which quickly became a staple of modern French literature."", 'When the Algerian War threatened to bring the unstable Fourth Republic to collapse, the National Assembly brought him back to power during the May 1958 crisis. He founded the Fifth Republic with a strong presidency; he was elected with 78% of the vote to continue in that role. He managed to keep France together while taking steps to end the war, much to the anger of the Pieds-Noirs (ethnic Europeans born in Algeria) and the armed forces. He granted independence to Algeria and acted progressively towards other French colonies. In the context of the Cold War, De Gaulle initiated his ""politics of grandeur"", asserting that France as a major power should not rely on other countries, such as the United States, for its national security and prosperity. To this end, he pursued a policy of ""national independence"" which led him to withdraw from NATO\'s integrated military command and to launch an independent nuclear strike force that made France the world\'s fourth nuclear power. He restored cordial Franco-German relations with Konrad Adenauer to create a European counterweight between the Anglo-American and Soviet spheres of influence through the signing of the Élysée Treaty on 22 January 1963.', 'De Gaulle opposed any development of a supranational Europe, favouring Europe as a continent of sovereign nations. De Gaulle openly criticised the US intervention in Vietnam and the ""exorbitant privilege"" of the US dollar. In his later years, his support for the slogan ""Vive le Québec libre"" and his two vetoes of Britain\'s entry into the European Economic Community generated considerable controversy in both North America and Europe. Although reelected to the presidency in 1965, he faced widespread protests by students and workers in May 68 but had the Army\'s support and won a snap election with an increased majority in the National Assembly. De Gaulle resigned in 1969 after losing a referendum in which he proposed more decentralisation. He died a year later at the age of 79, leaving his presidential memoirs unfinished. Many French political parties and leaders claim a Gaullist legacy; many streets and monuments in France and other parts of the world were dedicated to his memory after his death.', 'Charles André Joseph Marie de Gaulle was born on 22 November 1890 in Lille, the third of five children.[2] He was raised in a devoutly Catholic and traditional family. His father, Henri de Gaulle, was a professor of history and literature at a Jesuit college and eventually founded his own school.[3]:\u200a42–47\u200a', 'Henri de Gaulle came from a long line of parliamentary gentry from Normandy and Burgundy.[4]:\u200a13–16\u200a[5] The name is thought to be Dutch in origin, and may have derived from van der Walle, de Walle (""from the rampart, defensive wall"") or de Waal (""the wall"")[6][3]:\u200a42\u200a De Gaulle\'s mother, Jeanne (born Maillot), descended from a family of wealthy entrepreneurs from Lille. She had French, Irish, Scottish, and German ancestry.[4]:\u200a13–16\u200a[5]', ""De Gaulle's father encouraged historical and philosophical debate between his children, and through his encouragement, de Gaulle learned French history from an early age. Struck by his mother's tales of how she cried as a child when she heard of the French capitulation to the Germans at Sedan in 1870, he developed a keen interest in military strategy. He was also influenced by his uncle, also named Charles de Gaulle, who was a historian and passionate Celticist who advocated the union of the Welsh, Scots, Irish, and Bretons into one people. His grandfather Julien-Philippe was also a historian, and his grandmother Joséphine-Marie wrote poems which impassioned his Christian faith.[7][3]:\u200a42–47\u200a"", 'De Gaulle began writing in his early teens, especially poetry; his family paid for a composition, a one-act verse play, to be privately published.[8] A voracious reader, he favored philosophical tomes by such writers as Bergson, Péguy, and Barrès. In addition to the German philosophers Nietzsche, Kant, and Goethe, he read the works of the ancient Greeks (especially Plato) and the prose of Chateaubriand.[8]', 'De Gaulle was educated in Paris at the Collège Stanislas and studied briefly in Belgium.[3]:\u200a51–53\u200a At the age of fifteen he wrote an essay imagining ""General de Gaulle"" leading the French Army to victory over Germany in 1930; he later wrote that in his youth he had looked forward with somewhat naive anticipation to the inevitable future war with Germany to avenge the French defeat of 1870.[9]', ""France during de Gaulle's adolescence was a divided society, with many developments which were unwelcome to the de Gaulle family: the growth of socialism and syndicalism, the legal separation of Church and state in 1905, and the reduction in the term of military service to two years. Equally unwelcome were the Entente Cordiale with Britain, the First Moroccan Crisis, and above all the Dreyfus Affair. Henri de Gaulle came to be a supporter of Dreyfus, but was less concerned with his innocence per se than with the disgrace which the army had brought onto itself. The period also saw a resurgence in evangelical Catholicism, the dedication of the Sacré-Cœur, Paris, and the rise of the cult of Joan of Arc.[3]:\u200a50–51\u200a[9]"", 'De Gaulle was not an outstanding pupil until his mid-teens, but from July 1906 he focused on winning a place at the military academy, Saint-Cyr.[10] Lacouture suggests that de Gaulle joined the army, despite being more suited to a career as a writer and historian, partly to please his father and partly because it was one of the few unifying forces which represented the whole of French society.[11] He later wrote that ""when I entered the Army, it was one of the greatest things in the world"",[3]:\u200a51\u200a a claim which Lacouture points out needs to be treated with caution: the army\'s reputation was at a low. It was used extensively for strike-breaking and there were fewer than 700 applicants for Saint-Cyr in 1908, down from 2,000 at the turn of the century.[11]', 'De Gaulle won a place at Saint-Cyr in 1909. His class ranking was mediocre (119th out of 221).[10] Under a law of 21 March 1905, aspiring army officers were required to serve a year in the ranks, including time as a private and as an NCO, before attending the academy. Accordingly, in October 1909, de Gaulle enlisted (for four years, as required, rather than the normal two-year term for conscripts) in the 33rd Infantry Regiment\xa0[fr] of the French Army, based at Arras.[12] This was a historic regiment with Austerlitz, Wagram, and Borodino amongst its battle honours.[13] In April 1910 he was promoted to corporal. His company commander declined to promote him to sergeant, the usual rank for a potential officer, commenting that the young man clearly felt that nothing less than Constable of France would be good enough for him.[14][12] He was eventually promoted to sergeant in September 1910.[15]', 'De Gaulle took up his place at Saint-Cyr in October 1910. By the end of his first year he had risen to 45th place.[16] He was nicknamed ""the great asparagus"" because of his height (196\xa0cm, 6\'5""), high forehead, and nose.[3]:\u200a301\u200a He did well at the academy and received praise for his conduct, manners, intelligence, character, military spirit, and resistance to fatigue. In 1912, he graduated 13th in his class[17] and his passing-out report noted that he was a gifted cadet who would undoubtedly make an excellent officer. The future Marshal Alphonse Juin was first in the class, although the two do not appear to have been close at the time.[18]', 'Preferring to serve in France rather than the overseas colonies, in October 1912 he rejoined the 33rd Infantry Regiment as a second lieutenant. The regiment was now commanded by Colonel (and future Marshal) Philippe Pétain, whom de Gaulle would follow for the next 15 years. He later wrote in his memoirs: ""My first colonel, Pétain, taught me the art of command"".[19][18]', 'It has been claimed that in the build-up to World War I, de Gaulle agreed with Pétain about the obsolescence of cavalry and of traditional tactics, and often debated great battles and the likely outcome of any coming war with his superior.[7] Lacouture is sceptical, pointing out that although Pétain wrote glowing appraisals of de Gaulle in 1913, it is unlikely that he stood out among the 19 captains and 32 lieutenants under his command. De Gaulle would have been present at the 1913 Arras manoeuvres, at which Pétain criticised General Gallet\xa0[fr] to his face, but there is no evidence in his notebooks that he accepted Pétain\'s unfashionable ideas about the importance of firepower against the dominant doctrine emphasizing ""offensive spirit"". De Gaulle stressed how Maurice de Saxe had banned volley fire, how French armies of the Napoleonic period had relied on infantry column attack, and how French military power had declined in the nineteenth century because of – supposedly – excessive concentration on firepower rather than élan. He also appears to have accepted the then fashionable lesson drawn from the recent Russo-Japanese War, of how bayonet charges by Japanese infantry with high morale had succeeded in the face of enemy firepower.[20]', 'De Gaulle was promoted to first lieutenant in October 1913.[21]', 'When war broke out in France in early August 1914, the 33rd Regiment, considered one of the best fighting units in France, was immediately thrown into checking the German advance at Dinant. However, the French Fifth Army commander, General Charles Lanrezac, remained wedded to 19th-century battle tactics, throwing his units into pointless bayonet charges against German artillery, incurring heavy losses.[7]', 'As a platoon commander, de Gaulle was involved in fierce fighting from the outset. He received his baptism of fire on 15 August and was among the first to be wounded, receiving a bullet in the knee at the Battle of Dinant.[15][3]:\u200a58\u200a It is sometimes claimed that in hospital, he grew bitter at the tactics used, and spoke with other injured officers against the outdated methods of the French army. However, there is no contemporary evidence that he understood the importance of artillery in modern warfare. Instead, in his writing at the time, he criticised the ""overrapid"" offensive, the inadequacy of French generals, and the ""slowness of the English troops"".[22]', 'He rejoined his regiment in October, as commander of the 7th company. Many of his former comrades were already dead. In December he became regimental adjutant.[15]', ""De Gaulle's unit gained recognition for repeatedly crawling out into no man's land to listen to the conversations of the enemy, and the information brought back was so valuable that on 18 January 1915 he received the Croix de Guerre. On 10 February he was promoted to captain, initially on probation.[15] On 10 March 1915, de Gaulle was shot in the left hand, a wound which initially seemed trivial but became infected.[23] The wound incapacitated him for four months and later forced him to wear his wedding ring on the right hand.[3]:\u200a61\u200a[15][24] In August he commanded the 10th company before returning to duty as regimental adjutant. On 3 September 1915 his rank of captain became permanent. In late October, he returned to command of 10th company.[15]"", 'As a company commander at Douaumont (during the Battle of Verdun) on 2 March 1916, while leading a charge to try to break out of a position which had become surrounded, he received a bayonet wound to the left thigh after being stunned by a shell and was captured after passing out from the effects of poison gas. He was one of the few survivors of his battalion.[25][15][3]:\u200a63\u200a The circumstances of his capture would later become a subject of debate as anti-Gaullists spread rumour that he had actually surrendered, a claim de Gaulle nonchalantly dismissed.[26]', 'De Gaulle spent 32 months in six different prisoner camps, but he spent most time in the Ingolstadt Fortress\xa0[de],[27]:\u200a40\u200a where his treatment was satisfactory.[25]', 'In captivity, de Gaulle read German newspapers (he had learned German at school and spent a summer vacation in Germany) and gave talks on his view of the conflict to fellow prisoners. His patriotic fervour and confidence in victory earned him the nickname Le Connétable (""The Constable""), the title of the medieval commander-in-chief of the French army.[28] In Ingolstadt were also journalist Remy Roure, who would eventually become a political ally of de Gaulle,[29][30] and Mikhail Tukhachevsky, a future commander of the Red Army. De Gaulle became acquainted with Tukhachevsky, whose theories about a fast-moving, mechanized army closely resembled his. He also wrote his first book, Discorde chez l\'ennemi (The Enemy\'s House Divided), analysing the divisions within the German forces. The book was published in 1924.[3]:\u200a83\u200a', ""Originally interned at Rosenberg Fortress, he was quickly moved to progressively higher-security facilities like Ingolstadt. De Gaulle made five unsuccessful escape attempts,[15] and was routinely punished with long periods of solitary confinement and the withdrawal of privileges such as newspapers and tobacco. He attempted escape by hiding in a laundry basket, digging a tunnel, digging through a wall, and even posing as a nurse.[31][19] In letters to his parents, he constantly spoke of his frustration that the war was continuing without him. As the war neared its end, he grew depressed that he was playing no part in the victory, but he remained in captivity until the armistice. On 1 December 1918, three weeks later, he returned to his father's house in the Dordogne to be reunited with his three brothers, who had all also served in the army."", ""After the armistice, de Gaulle served with the staff of the French Military Mission to Poland as an instructor of Poland's infantry during its war with communist Russia (1919–1921). He distinguished himself in operations near the River Zbrucz, with the rank of major in the Polish army, and won Poland's highest military decoration, the Virtuti Militari.[3]:\u200a71–74\u200a"", 'De Gaulle returned to France, where he became a lecturer in military history at Saint-Cyr.[32] He studied at the École de Guerre (staff college) from November 1922 to October 1924. Here he clashed with his instructor Colonel Moyrand by arguing for tactics based on circumstances rather than doctrine, and after an exercise in which he had played the role of commander, he refused to answer a question about supplies, replying ""de minimis non curat praetor"" (roughly: ""a leader does not concern himself with trivia"") before ordering the responsible officer to answer Moyrand. ', 'He obtained respectable, but not outstanding grades on many of his assessments. Moyrand wrote in his final report that he was ""an intelligent, cultured and serious-minded officer; has brilliance and talent"" but criticised him for not deriving as much benefit from the course as he should have, and for his arrogance: his ""excessive self-confidence"", his harsh dismissal of the views of others ""and his attitude of a King in exile"". Having entered 33rd out of 129, he graduated in 52nd place, with a grade of assez bien (""good enough""). He was posted to Mainz to help supervise supplies of food and equipment for the French Army of Occupation.[33][3]:\u200a82\u200aDe Gaulle\'s book La Discorde chez l\'ennemi had appeared in March 1924. In March 1925 he published an essay on the use of tactics according to circumstances, a deliberate defiance of Moyrand.[34]', 'De Gaulle\'s career was saved by Pétain, who arranged for his staff college grade to be amended to bien (""good""—but not the ""excellent"" needed for a general staff posting).[3]:\u200a82–83\u200a From 1 July 1925 he worked for Pétain (as part of the Maison Pétain), largely as a ""pen officer"" (ghostwriter).[35] De Gaulle disapproved of Pétain\'s decision to take command in Morocco in 1925 (he was later known to remark that ""Marshal Pétain was a great man. He died in 1925, but he did not know it"") and of what he saw as the lust for public adulation of Pétain and his wife. In 1925 de Gaulle began to cultivate Joseph Paul-Boncour, his first political patron.[36] On 1 December 1925 he published an essay on the ""Historical Role of French Fortresses"". This was a popular topic because of the Maginot Line which was then being planned, but he argued that the aim of fortresses should be to weaken the enemy, not to economise on defence.[35]', ""Friction arose between de Gaulle and Pétain over Le Soldat, a history of the French soldier which he had ghost-written and for which he wanted greater writing credit. He had written mainly historical material, but Pétain wanted to add a final chapter of his own thoughts. There was at least one stormy meeting late in 1926 after which de Gaulle was seen to emerge, white with anger, from Pétain's office.[37] In October 1926 he returned to his duties with the Headquarters of the Army of the Rhine.[38]"", 'De Gaulle had sworn that he would never return to the École de Guerre except as commandant, but at Pétain\'s invitation, and introduced to the stage by his patron, he delivered three lectures there in April 1927: ""Leadership in Wartime"", ""Character"", and ""Prestige"". These later formed the basis for his book The Edge of the Sword (1932).[39]', 'After spending twelve years as a captain, a normal period, de Gaulle was promoted to commandant (major) on 25 September 1927.[39] In November 1927 he began a two-year posting as commanding officer of the 19th chasseurs à pied (a battalion of élite light infantry) with the occupation forces at Trier.[40][3]:\u200a94\u200a', 'De Gaulle trained his men hard (a river crossing exercise of the freezing Moselle River at night was vetoed by his commanding general). He imprisoned a soldier for appealing to his deputy for a transfer to a cushier unit, and when investigated initially tried to invoke his status as a member of the Maison Pétain, eventually appealing to Pétain to protect himself from a reprimand for interfering with the soldier\'s political rights. An observer wrote of de Gaulle at this time that although he encouraged young officers, ""his ego...glowed from far off"". In the winter of 1928–1929, thirty soldiers (""not counting Annamese"") died from so-called ""German flu"", seven of them from de Gaulle\'s battalion. After an investigation, he was singled out for praise in the ensuing parliamentary debate as an exceptionally capable commanding officer, and mention of how he had worn a mourning band for a private soldier who was an orphan earned praise from the Prime Minister Raymond Poincaré.[41]', ""The breach between de Gaulle and Pétain over the ghost-writing of Le Soldat had deepened in 1928. Pétain brought in a new ghostwriter, Colonel Audet, who was unwilling to take on the job and wrote to de Gaulle in some embarrassment to take over the project. Pétain was quite friendly about the matter but did not publish the book.[42] In 1929 Pétain did not use de Gaulle's draft text for his eulogy for the late Ferdinand Foch, whose seat at the Académie Française he was assuming.[37]"", ""The Allied occupation of the Rhineland was ending, and de Gaulle's battalion was due to be disbanded, although the decision was later rescinded after he had moved to his next posting. De Gaulle wanted a teaching post at the École de Guerre in 1929.[43] There was apparently a threat of mass resignation of the faculty were he appointed. There was talk of a posting to Corsica or North Africa, but on Pétain's advice he accepted a two-year posting to Lebanon and Syria.[3]:\u200a93–94\u200a In Beirut he was chief of the 3rd Bureau (military operations) of General Louis-Paul-Gaston de Bigault du Granrut, who wrote him a glowing reference recommending him for high command.[44]"", 'In the spring of 1931, as his posting in Beirut drew to a close, de Gaulle once again asked Pétain for a posting to the École de Guerre. Pétain tried to obtain an appointment for him as Professor of History there, but once again the faculty would not have him. Instead de Gaulle, drawing on plans he had drawn up in 1928 for reform of that institution, asked Pétain to create a special post for him which would enable him to lecture on ""the Conduct of War"" both to the École de Guerre and to the Centre des Hautes Études Militaires (CHEM – a senior staff college for generals, known as the ""school for marshals""), to civilians at the École Normale Supérieure, and to civil servants.[45]', 'Pétain instead advised him to apply for a posting to the Secrétariat Général du Conseil Supérieur de la Défense Nationale (SGDN – General Secretariat of the Supreme War Council) in Paris. Pétain promised to lobby for the appointment, which he thought would be good experience for him. De Gaulle was posted to SGDN in November 1931, initially as a ""drafting officer"".[45][3]:\u200a94\u200a', ""He was promoted to lieutenant-colonel in December 1932 and appointed Head of the Third Section (operations). His service at SGDN gave him six years' experience of the interface between army planning and government, enabling him to take on ministerial responsibilities in 1940.[3]:\u200a97\u200a[46]"", 'After studying arrangements in the US, Italy, and Belgium, de Gaulle drafted a bill for the organisation of the country in wartime. He made a presentation about his bill to the CHEM. The bill passed the Chamber of Deputies but failed in the Senate.[47]', 'Unlike Pétain, de Gaulle believed in the use of tanks and rapid maneuvers rather than trench warfare.[3]:\u200a108\u200a De Gaulle became a disciple of Émile Mayer, a retired lieutenant-colonel (his career had been damaged by the Dreyfus Affair) and military thinker. Mayer thought that although wars were still bound to happen, it was ""obsolete"" for civilised countries to threaten or wage war on one another. He had a low opinion of French generals, and was a critic of the Maginot Line and a proponent of mechanised warfare. Lacouture suggests that Mayer focused de Gaulle\'s thoughts away from his obsession with the mystique of the strong leader (Le Fil d\'Epée: 1932) and back to loyalty to Republican institutions and military reform.[48]', 'In 1934 de Gaulle wrote Vers l\'Armée de Métier (Towards a Professional Army). He proposed mechanization of the infantry, with stress on an élite force of 100,000 men and 3,000 tanks. The book imagined tanks driving around the country like cavalry. De Gaulle\'s mentor Emile Mayer was somewhat more prophetic than he was about the future importance of air power on the battlefield. Such an army would both compensate for France\'s population shortage, and be an efficient tool to enforce international law, particularly the Treaty of Versailles. He also thought it would be a precursor to a deeper national reorganisation, and wrote that ""a master has to make his appearance [...] whose orders cannot be challenged – a man upheld by public opinion"".[49]', ""Only 700 copies were sold in France; the claim that thousands of copies were sold in Germany[19] is thought to be an exaggeration. De Gaulle used the book to widen his contacts among journalists, notably with André Pironneau, editor of L'Écho de Paris. The book attracted praise across the political spectrum, apart from the hard left who were committed to the Republican ideal of a citizen army.[50] De Gaulle's views attracted the attention of the maverick politician Paul Reynaud, to whom he wrote frequently, sometimes in obsequious terms. Reynaud first invited him to meet him on 5 December 1934.[51]"", ""De Gaulle was deeply focused on his career at this time. There is no evidence that he was tempted by fascism, and there is little evidence of his views either on domestic upheavals in 1934 and 1936 or the many foreign policy crises of the decade.[52] He approved of the rearmament drive which the Popular Front government began in 1936, although French military doctrine remained that tanks should be used in penny packets for infantry support (ironically, in 1940 it would be German panzer units that would be used in a manner similar to what de Gaulle had advocated).[53] A rare insight into de Gaulle's political views is a letter to his mother warning that war with Germany was inevitable and reassuring her that Pierre Laval's pact with the USSR in 1935 was for the best, likening it to Francis I's alliance with the Turks against Emperor Charles V.[54]"", ""From April 1936, whilst still in his staff position at SGDN, de Gaulle was a lecturer to generals at CHEM.[47] De Gaulle's superiors disapproved of his views about tanks, and he was passed over for promotion to full colonel in 1936, supposedly because his service record was not good enough. He called on his political patron Reynaud, who showed his record to Minister of War Édouard Daladier. Daladier, who was an enthusiast for rearmament with modern weapons, ensured that his name was on the promotion list for the following year.[3]:\u200a109\u200a[55]"", 'In 1937 General Bineau, who had taught him at Saint-Cyr, wrote on his report on his lectureship at CHEM that he was highly able and suitable for high command in the future, but that he hid his attributes under ""a cold and lofty attitude"".[47] He was put in command of the 507th Tank Regiment (a battalion of medium Char D2s and a battalion of R35 light tanks) at Metz on 13 July 1937, and his promotion to full colonel took effect on 24 December that year. De Gaulle attracted public attention by leading a parade of 80 tanks into the Place d\'Armes at Metz, in his command tank ""Austerlitz"".[56]', 'By now de Gaulle was becoming a well-known figure, known as ""Colonel Motor(s)"".[3]:\u200a117\u200a At the invitation of the publisher Plon, he produced another book, La France et son Armée (France and Her Army) in 1938. De Gaulle incorporated much of the text he had written for Pétain a decade earlier for the uncompleted book Le Soldat, to Pétain\'s displeasure. De Gaulle agreed to include a dedication to Pétain (although he wrote his own rather than using the draft Pétain sent him), which was dropped from postwar editions. Until 1938 Pétain had treated de Gaulle, as Lacouture puts it, ""with unbounded good will"", but by October 1938 he privately thought his former protégé ""an ambitious man, and very ill-bred"".[57]', ""At the outbreak of World War II, de Gaulle was put in command of the French Fifth Army's tanks (five scattered battalions, largely equipped with R35 light tanks) in Alsace. On 12 September 1939 he attacked at Bitche, simultaneously with the Saar Offensive.[58][3]:\u200a118\u200a"", ""At the start of October 1939, Reynaud asked for a staff posting under de Gaulle, but remained at his post as Minister of Finance. De Gaulle's tanks were inspected by President Lebrun, who was impressed, but regretted that it was too late to implement his ideas.[59] He wrote a paper L'Avènement de la force mécanique (The coming of the Armoured Force) which he sent to General Georges (commander-in-chief on the northeast front – who was not especially impressed) and the politician Leon Blum. Daladier, Prime Minister at the time, was too busy to read it.[60]"", ""In late February 1940, Reynaud told de Gaulle that he had been earmarked for command of an armoured division as soon as one became available.[61] Early in 1940 (the exact date is uncertain), de Gaulle proposed to Reynaud that he be appointed Secretary-General of the War Council, which would in effect make him the government's military adviser. When Reynaud became prime minister in March, he was reliant on Daladier's backing, so the job went instead to the politician Paul Baudouin.[62]"", 'In late March, Reynaud told de Gaulle that he would be given command of the 4th Armoured Division, due to form by 15 May.[63] The government appeared likely to be restructured, as Daladier and Maurice Gamelin (commander-in-chief) were under attack in the aftermath of the Allied defeat in Norway, and had this happened de Gaulle, who on 3 May, was still lobbying Reynaud for a restructuring of the control of the war, might well have joined the government.[64] By 7 May he was assembling the staff of his new division.[65]', ""The Germans attacked the West on 10 May.[64] De Gaulle activated his new division on 12 May.[65] The Germans broke through at Sedan on 15 May 1940.[66] That day, with three tank battalions assembled, less than a third of his paper strength, he was summoned to headquarters and told to attack to gain time for General Robert Touchon's Sixth Army to redeploy from the Maginot Line to the Aisne. General Georges told him it was his chance to implement his ideas.[67][19]"", ""The attack at Montcornet, a key road junction near Laon, began around 04:30 on 17 May. Outnumbered and without air support, he lost 23 of his 90 vehicles to mines, anti-tank weapons, and Stukas. On 18 May he was reinforced by two fresh regiments of armoured cavalry, bringing his strength to 150 vehicles. He attacked again on 19 May and his forces were once again devastated. He ignored orders from General Georges to withdraw, and in the early afternoon demanded two more divisions from Touchon, who refused.[68] Although de Gaulle's tanks forced German infantry to retreat to Caumont, the action brought only temporary relief and did little to slow the spearhead of the German advance. Nevertheless, it was one of the few successes the French enjoyed while suffering defeats across the country.[69][70]"", ""De Gaulle's rank of brigadier-general became effective on 1 June 1940.[3]:\u200a127\u200a That day he was in Paris. After visiting his tailor to be fitted for his general's uniform, he met Reynaud, who appears to have offered him a government job for the first time, and afterwards the commander-in-chief Maxime Weygand, who congratulated him on saving France's honour and asked for his advice.[71] On 2 June he sent a memo to Weygand vainly urging that the French armoured divisions be consolidated from four weak divisions into three stronger ones and concentrated into an armoured corps under his command. He made the same suggestion to Reynaud.[71]"", 'On 5 June, the day the Germans began the second phase of their offensive (Fall Rot), Prime Minister Paul Reynaud appointed de Gaulle Under-Secretary of State for National Defence and War,[72] with particular responsibility for coordination with the British.[73] Weygand objected to the appointment, thinking him ""a mere child"".[74] Pétain (deputy prime minister) was also displeased and told Reynaud the story of the ghost-writing of Le Soldat.[74] His appointment received a good deal of press attention, both in France and in the UK. He asked for an English-speaking aide and Geoffroy Chodron de Courcel was given the job.[75]', 'On 8 June, de Gaulle visited Weygand, who believed it was ""the end"" and that after France was defeated Britain would soon sue for peace.[76] A day later, de Gaulle flew to London and met British Prime Minister Winston Churchill for the first time. It was thought that half a million men could be evacuated to French North Africa, provided the British and French navies and air forces coordinated their efforts. Either at this meeting or on 16 June, he urged Churchill in vain to throw more Royal Air Force (RAF) aircraft into the Battle of France but conceded that Churchill was right to refuse.[77]', ""On 11 June, de Gaulle drove to Arcis-sur-Aube and offered General Charles Huntziger Weygand's job as Commander-in-Chief. Huntziger accepted in principle, but de Gaulle was unable to persuade Reynaud to sack Weygand.[78] On 13 June, de Gaulle attended another Anglo-French conference at Tours with Churchill, Lord Halifax, Lord Beaverbrook, Edward Spears, Sir Hastings Ismay, and Sir Alexander Cadogan.[79] De Gaulle was dissuaded from resigning by the Interior Minister Georges Mandel, who argued that the war was just beginning, and that de Gaulle needed to keep his reputation unsullied.[80] Nevertheless, at around 9:00 on 17 June, de Gaulle flew to London on a British aircraft with Spears. De Gaulle later told André Malraux of the mental anguish which his flight to London – a break with the French Army and with the recognised government, which would inevitably be seen as treason by many – had caused him.[81]"", 'De Gaulle landed at Heston Airport soon after 12:30 on 17 June 1940. He saw Churchill at around 15:00 and Churchill offered him broadcast time on BBC. They both knew about Pétain\'s broadcast earlier that day that stated that ""the fighting must end"" and that he had approached the Germans for terms. That evening de Gaulle dined with Jean Monnet and denounced Pétain\'s ""treason"".[27]:\u200a125–128\u200a The next day the British Cabinet (Churchill was not present, as it was the day of his ""Finest Hour"" speech) were reluctant to agree to de Gaulle giving a radio address, as Britain was still in communication with the Pétain government about the fate of the French fleet. Duff Cooper (minister of information) had an advance copy of the address, to which there were no objections. The cabinet eventually agreed after individual lobbying, as indicated by a handwritten amendment to the cabinet minutes.[82][66]', ""De Gaulle's Appeal of 18 June exhorted the French people not to be demoralized and to continue to resist occupation. He also – apparently on his own initiative – declared that he would broadcast again the next day.[83] Few listened to the 18 June speech;[27]:\u200a4–6\u200a the speech was published in some newspapers in mainland France. It was largely aimed at French soldiers who were in Britain after being evacuated from Norway and Dunkirk; most showed no interest in fighting for de Gaulle's Free French Forces and were repatriated to France to become German prisoners of war.[84]The small audience of the 18 June appeal grew for later speeches,[27]:\u200a5–6\u200a and the press by early August described Free French military as fighting under de Gaulle's command,[85] although few in France knew anything about him.[27]:\u200a5–6\u200a"", 'The Vichy regime had already sentenced de Gaulle to four years\' imprisonment; on 2 August 1940 he was condemned to death by court martial in absentia,[86] although Pétain commented that he would ensure that the sentence was never carried out.[87] De Gaulle said of the sentence, ""I consider the act of the Vichy men as void; I shall have an explanation with them after the victory"".[85] He and Churchill reached agreement on 7 August 1940, that Britain would fund the Free French, with the bill to be settled after the war (the financial agreement was finalised in March 1941). A separate letter guaranteed the territorial integrity of the French Empire.[88]', 'De Gaulle\'s support grew out of a base in the colonial French Equatorial Africa. In the autumn of 1940, the colonial empire largely supported the Vichy regime. Félix Éboué, governor of Chad, switched his support to General de Gaulle in September. Encouraged, de Gaulle traveled to Brazzaville in October, where he announced the formation of an Empire Defense Council[89] in his ""Brazzaville Manifesto"",[90] and invited all colonies still supporting Vichy to join him and the Free French forces in the fight against Germany, which most of them did by 1943.[89][91]', ""Working with the French Resistance and other supporters in France's colonial African possessions after Operation Torch in November 1942, de Gaulle moved his headquarters to Algiers in May 1943. He became first joint head (with the less resolutely independent General Henri Giraud, the candidate preferred by the US who wrongly suspected de Gaulle of being a British puppet) and then—after squeezing out Giraud by force of personality—sole chairman of the French Committee of National Liberation.[66]"", 'De Gaulle was held in high regard by Allied commander General Dwight Eisenhower.[92] In Algiers in 1943, Eisenhower gave de Gaulle the assurance in person that a French force would liberate Paris and arranged that the army division of French General Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque would be transferred from North Africa to the UK to carry out that liberation.[92] Eisenhower was impressed by the combativeness of units of the Free French Forces and ""grateful for the part they had played in mopping up the remnants of German resistance""; he also detected how strongly devoted many were to de Gaulle and how ready they were to accept him as the national leader.[92]', 'As preparations for the liberation of Europe gathered pace, the US in particular found de Gaulle\'s tendency to view everything from the French perspective to be extremely tiresome. President Roosevelt, who refused to recognize any provisional authority in France until elections had been held, referred to de Gaulle as ""an apprentice dictator"", a view backed by a number of leading Frenchmen in Washington, including Jean Monnet, who later became instrumental in setting up the European Coal and Steel Community that led to the modern European Union. Roosevelt directed Churchill not to provide de Gaulle with strategic details of the imminent invasion because he did not trust him to keep the information to himself. French codes were considered weak, posing a risk since the Free French refused to use British or American codes.[93] De Gaulle refused to share coded information with the British, who were then obliged secretly to break the codes to read French messages.[94]', 'Upon his arrival at RAF Northolt on 4 June 1944 he received an official welcome.[93] Later, on his personal train, Churchill informed him that he wanted him to make a radio address, but when informed that the Americans continued to refuse to recognise his right to power in France, and after Churchill suggested he request a meeting with Roosevelt to improve his relationship with the president, de Gaulle became angry, demanding to know why he should ""lodge my candidacy for power in France with Roosevelt; the French government exists"".[3]', 'On 14 June 1944, he left Britain for the city of Bayeux, Normandy, which he proclaimed as the capital of Free France. Appointing his Aide-de-Camp Francois Coulet as head of the civil administration, de Gaulle returned to the UK that same night on a French destroyer, and although the official position of the supreme military command remained unchanged, local Allied officers found it more practical to deal with the fledgling administration in Bayeux in everyday matters.[93] De Gaulle flew to Algiers on 16 June and then went to Rome to meet the Pope and the new Italian government. ', ""At the beginning of July, he visited Roosevelt in Washington, where he received the 17-gun salute of a senior military leader rather than the 21 guns of a visiting head of state.[3] De Gaulle successfully lobbied for Paris to be made a priority for liberation on humanitarian grounds and obtained from Allied supreme commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower an agreement that French troops would be allowed to enter the capital first. A few days later, General Leclerc's division entered the outskirts of the city, and after six days of fighting in which the resistance played a major part, the German garrison of 5000 men surrendered on 25 August, although some sporadic fighting continued for several days.[95]"", 'On the evening of 26 August, the Wehrmacht launched a massive aerial and artillery barrage of Paris in revenge, leaving several thousand dead or injured.[96] The situation in Paris remained tense, and a few days later, de Gaulle asked General Eisenhower to send American troops into Paris as a show of strength. On 29 August, the US 28th Infantry Division was rerouted from its journey to the front line and paraded down the Champs Elysees.[96][97]', 'The same day, Washington and London agreed to accept the position of the Free French. The following day General Eisenhower gave his de facto blessing with a visit to the General in Paris.[98]', 'Roosevelt insisted that an Allied Military Government for Occupied Territories (AMGOT) should be implemented in France, but this was opposed by both the Secretary and Under-Secretary of War, as well as by Eisenhower, who had been strongly opposed to the imposition of AMGOT in North Africa. Eisenhower, unlike Roosevelt, wanted to cooperate with de Gaulle, and he secured a last-minute promise from the President on the eve of D-Day that the Allied officers would not act as military governors and would instead cooperate with the local authorities as the Allied forces liberated French Territory. De Gaulle would later claim in his memoirs that he blocked AMGOT.[99]', 'With the prewar parties and most of their leaders discredited, there was little opposition to de Gaulle and his associates forming an interim administration. In order not to be seen as presuming on his position in such austere times, de Gaulle did not use one of the grand official residences such as Hotel de Matignon or the Élysée Palace, but resided briefly in his old office at the Ministry of War. When he was joined by his wife and daughters, they moved into a small state-owned villa on edge of Bois de Boulogne which had once been set aside for Hermann Göring.[100]', 'On 10 November 1944, Churchill flew to Paris to a reception by de Gaulle and the two together were greeted by thousands of cheering Parisians on the next day.[101] Harold Nicolson stated that Anthony Eden told him that ""not for one moment did Winston stop crying, and that he could have filled buckets by the time he received the Freedom of Paris.""[101] At an official luncheon, de Gaulle said: ', 'It is true that we would not have seen [the liberation] if our old and gallant ally England, and all the British dominions under precisely the impulsion and inspiration of those we are honouring today, had not deployed the extraordinary determination to win, and that magnificent courage which saved the freedom of the world. There is no French man or woman who is not touched to the depths of their hearts and souls by this.[101]', ""Keenly aware of the need to seize the initiative and get the process under firm judicial control, de Gaulle appointed Justice Minister François de Menthon to lead the Legal Purge (Épuration légale) to punish traitors and clear away traces of the Vichy regime. Knowing that he would need to reprieve many of the 'economic collaborators'—such as police and civil servants who held minor roles under Vichy to keep the country running—he assumed, as head of state, the right to commute death sentences.[3] Of the near 2,000 people who received the death sentence from the courts, fewer than 800 were executed. De Gaulle commuted 998 of the 1,554 capital sentences submitted before him, including all women. Many others were given jail terms or had their voting rights and other legal privileges taken away. It is generally agreed that the purges were conducted arbitrarily, with often absurdly severe or overly lenient punishments being handed down.[100] Less well-off people who were unable to pay for lawyers were more harshly treated. As time went by and feelings grew less intense, a number of people who had held fairly senior positions under the Vichy government—such as Maurice Papon and René Bousquet—escaped consequences by claiming to have worked secretly for the resistance or to have played a double game, working for the good of France by serving the established order.[100]"", 'Pétain received a death sentence, which his old protégé de Gaulle commuted to life imprisonment, while Maxime Weygand was eventually acquitted. There was a widespread belief, particularly in the years that followed, that de Gaulle was trying to appease both the Third Republic politicians and the former Vichy leaders who had made Laval their scapegoat.[100]', 'De Gaulle was never invited to the summit conferences of Allied leaders such as Yalta and Potsdam. He never forgave the Big Three leaders (Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin) for their neglect and continued to rage against it as having been a negative factor in European politics for the rest of his life.[7]', 'After the Rhine crossings, the French First Army captured a large section of territory in southern Germany, but although this later allowed France to play a part in the signing of the German surrender, Roosevelt in particular refused to allow any discussion about de Gaulle participating in the Big Three conferences that would shape Europe in the post-war world. Churchill pressed hard for France to be included \'at the inter-allied table\', but on 6 December 1944 the American president wired both Stalin and Churchill to say that de Gaulle\'s presence would ""merely introduce a complicating and undesirable factor"".[102]', ""At the Yalta Conference in February 1945, despite Stalin's opposition, Churchill and Roosevelt insisted that France be allowed a post-war occupation zone in Germany, and also made sure that it was included among the five nations that invited others to the conference to establish the United Nations. This guaranteed France a permanent seat on the UN Security Council.[103]"", 'In May 1945 the German armies surrendered to the Americans and British at Rheims, and a separate armistice was signed with France in Berlin.[104] De Gaulle refused to allow any British participation in the victory parade in Paris. However, among the vehicles that took part was an ambulance from the Hadfield-Spears Ambulance Unit, staffed by French doctors and British nurses. One of the nurses was Mary Spears, who had set up the unit and had worked almost continuously since the Battle of France with Free French forces in the Middle East, North Africa and Italy. Mary\'s husband was General Edward Spears, the British liaison to the Free French who had personally spirited de Gaulle to safety in Britain in 1940. When de Gaulle saw the Union Flags and Tricolours side by side on the ambulance, and heard French soldiers cheering, ""Voilà Spears! Vive Spears!"", he ordered that the unit be closed down immediately and its British staff sent home. A number of French troops returned their medals in protest and Mary wrote, ""it is a pitiful business when a great man suddenly becomes small.""[105]', ""Another confrontation with the Americans broke out soon after the armistice when the French sent troops to occupy the French-speaking Italian border region of Val d'Aoste. The French commander threatened to fire on American troops if they tried to stop them, and an irate Truman ordered the immediate end to all arms shipments to France. Truman sent de Gaulle an angry letter saying that he found it unbelievable that the French could threaten to attack American troops after they had done so much to liberate France.[7]"", ""Within the same month another crisis developed in Syria where French troops tried to quell nationalist protests at the continued occupation of the Levant. Winston Churchill opposed French action and after they refused to negotiate he ordered British forces into Syria from Transjordan with orders to fire on the French if necessary.[106] Known as the Levant Crisis, British forces swept into Syria forcing the French to stand down, and with political pressure added by the United States and Soviet Union, the French ordered a ceasefire. This crisis further infuriated Truman, and France evacuated its troops later in the year but de Gaulle said to the British ambassador Duff Cooper, 'you have betrayed France and betrayed the West. That cannot be forgotten'.[3]:\u200a47\u200a"", 'De Gaulle was generally well received in the United States immediately after World War II and supported the US in public comments. He visited New York City on 27 August 1945 to great welcome by thousands of people of the city and its mayor Fiorello La Guardia.[107][108] On that day, de Gaulle wished ""Long live the United States of America"". He visited New York City Hall and Idlewild Airport (now John F. Kennedy International Airport), and presented LaGuardia with the Grand Croix of the Legion of Honour award.[107][108]', 'Since the liberation, the only parliament in France had been an enlarged version of the Algiers Provisional Consultative Assembly, and at last, in October 1945, elections were held for a new Constituent Assembly whose main task was to provide a new constitution for the Fourth Republic. De Gaulle favoured a strong executive for the nation,[19] but all three of the main parties wished to severely restrict the powers of the president. The Communists wanted an assembly with full constitutional powers and no time limit, whereas de Gaulle, the Socialists and the Popular Republican Movement (MRP) advocated one with a term limited to only seven months, after which the draft constitution would be submitted for another referendum.[109]', 'On 13 November 1945, the new assembly unanimously elected Charles de Gaulle head of the government, but problems immediately arose when it came to selecting the cabinet, due to his unwillingness to allow the Communists any important ministries. The Communists, now the largest party and with their charismatic leader Maurice Thorez back at the helm, were not prepared to accept this for a second time, and a furious row ensued, during which de Gaulle sent a letter of resignation to the speaker of the Assembly and declared that he was unwilling to trust a party that he considered to be an agent of a foreign power (Russia) with authority over the police and armed forces.[7]', 'Eventually, the new cabinet was finalised on 21 November, with the Communists receiving five out of the twenty-two ministries, and although they still did not get any key portfolios, de Gaulle believed that the draft constitution placed too much power in the hands of parliament with its shifting party alliances. One of his ministers said he was ""a man equally incapable of monopolizing power as of sharing it"".[110]', 'De Gaulle outlined a programme of further nationalisations and a new economic plan which were passed, but a further row came when the Communists demanded a 20-percent reduction in the military budget. Refusing to ""rule by compromise"", de Gaulle once more threatened to resign. There was a general feeling that he was trying to blackmail the assembly into complete subservience.[100] Although the MRP managed to broker a compromise which saw the budget approved with amendments, it was a stop-gap measure.[7]', 'Barely two months after forming the new government, de Gaulle abruptly resigned on 20 January 1946. The move was called ""a bold and ultimately foolish political ploy"", with de Gaulle hoping that as a war hero, he would be soon brought back as a more powerful executive by the French people.[111] However, that did not turn out to be the case. With the war finally over, the initial crisis had passed. Although there were still shortages, particularly of bread, France was now recovering, and de Gaulle suddenly did not seem so indispensable. The Communist publication Combat wrote, ""There was no cataclysm, and the empty plate didn\'t crack"".[100]', 'De Gaulle suddenly dropped out of sight and returned to his home in Colombey to write his war memoirs. De Gaulle had told Pierre Bertaux in 1944 that he planned to retire because ""France may still one day need an image that is pure ... If Joan of Arc had married, she would no longer have been Joan of Arc"".[112] The famous opening paragraph of Mémoires de guerre begins by declaring, ""All my life, I have had a certain idea of France (une certaine idée de la France)"",[113]:\u200a2\u200a and ends by declaring that, given the divisive nature of French politics, France cannot truly live up to this ideal without a policy of ""grandeur"". During this period of formal retirement, however, de Gaulle maintained regular contact with past political lieutenants, including sympathizers involved in political developments in French Algeria, becoming ""perhaps the best-informed man in France"".[19]', ""In April 1947, de Gaulle made a renewed attempt to transform the political scene by creating a Rassemblement du Peuple Français (Rally of the French People, RPF), which he hoped would be able to move above the party squabbles of the parliamentary system. Despite the new party's taking 40 percent of the vote in local elections and 121 seats in 1951, lacking its own press and access to television, its support ebbed. In May 1953, he withdrew again from active politics,[19] though the RPF lingered until September 1955.[114]"", ""As with all colonial powers France began to lose its overseas possessions amid the surge of nationalism. French Indochina (now Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia), colonised by France during the mid-19th century, had been lost to the Japanese after the defeat of 1940. De Gaulle had intended to hold on to France's Indochina colony, ordering the parachuting of French agents and arms into Indochina in late 1944 and early 1945 with orders to attack the Japanese as American troops hit the beaches.[115] Although de Gaulle had moved quickly to consolidate French control of the territory during his brief first tenure as president in the 1940s, the communist Vietminh under Ho Chi Minh began a determined campaign for independence from 1946. The French fought a bitter seven-year war (the First Indochina War) to hold on to Indochina. It was largely funded by the United States and grew increasingly unpopular, especially after the stunning defeat at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in May 1954. France pulled out that summer under Prime Minister Pierre Mendès France."", 'The independence of Morocco and Tunisia was arranged by Mendès France and proclaimed in March 1956. Meanwhile, in Algeria some 350,000 French troops were fighting 150,000 combatants of the Algerian Liberation Movement (FLN). Within a few years, the Algerian war of independence reached a summit in terms of savagery and bloodshed and threatened to spill into metropolitan France itself.', 'Between 1946 and 1958 the Fourth Republic had 24 separate ministries. Frustrated by the endless divisiveness, de Gaulle famously asked, ""How can you govern a country which has 246 varieties of cheese?""[116]', 'The Fourth Republic was wracked by political instability, failures in Indochina, and inability to resolve the Algerian question.[117][118]', 'On 13 May 1958, Pied-Noir settlers seized the government buildings in Algiers, attacking what they saw as French government weakness in prosecuting the war against the FLN. A ""Committee of Civil and Army Public Security"" was created under the presidency of General Jacques Massu, a Gaullist sympathiser. General Raoul Salan, Commander-in-Chief in Algeria, announced on radio that he was assuming provisional power, and appealed for confidence in himself.[119]', 'At a 19 May press conference, de Gaulle asserted that he was at the disposal of the country. As a journalist expressed the concerns of some who feared that he would violate civil liberties, de Gaulle retorted: ""Have I ever done that? On the contrary, I have re-established them when they had disappeared. Who honestly believes that, at age 67, I would start a career as a dictator?""[120] A constitutionalist by conviction, he maintained  that he would accept power only from the lawfully constituted authorities. De Gaulle did not wish to repeat the difficulty the Free French movement experienced in establishing legitimacy as the rightful government. He told an aide that the rebel generals ""will not find de Gaulle in their baggage"".[19]', 'The crisis deepened as French paratroops from Algeria seized Corsica and a landing near Paris was discussed (Operation Resurrection).[121]', ""Political leaders on many sides agreed to support the General's return to power, except François Mitterrand, Pierre Mendès France, Alain Savary, the Communist Party, and certain other leftists."", 'On 29 May the French President, René Coty, told parliament that the nation was on the brink of civil war, so he was ', 'turning towards the most illustrious of Frenchmen, towards the man who, in the darkest years of our history, was our chief for the reconquest of freedom and who refused dictatorship in order to re-establish the Republic. I ask General de Gaulle to confer with the head of state and to examine with him what, in the framework of Republican legality, is necessary for the immediate formation of a government of national safety and what can be done, in a fairly short time, for a deep reform of our institutions.[122]', "" De Gaulle accepted Coty's proposal under the precondition that a new constitution would be introduced creating a powerful presidency in which a sole executive, the first of which was to be himself, ruled for seven-year periods. Another condition was that he be granted extraordinary powers for a period of six months.[123]"", ""De Gaulle remained intent on replacing the weak constitution of the Fourth Republic. He is sometimes described as the author of the new constitution, as he commissioned it and was responsible for its overall framework. The actual drafter of the text was Michel Debré who wrote up de Gaulle's political ideas and guided the text through the enactment process. On 1 June 1958, de Gaulle became Prime Minister and was given emergency powers for six months by the National Assembly,[124] fulfilling his desire for parliamentary legitimacy.[19]"", ""De Gaulle's cabinet received strong support from right-wing parties, split support from left of center parties, and strong opposition from the Communist Party. In the vote on 1 June 1958, 329 votes were cast in favor and 224 against, out of 593 deputies.[125] On 28 September 1958, a referendum took place and 82.6 percent of those who voted supported the new constitution and the creation of the Fifth Republic. The colonies (Algeria was officially a part of France, not a colony) were given the choice between immediate independence and the new constitution. All African colonies voted for the new constitution and the replacement of the French Union by the French Community, except Guinea, which became the first French African colony to gain independence and immediately lost all French assistance.[126]"", 'In the November 1958 election, Charles de Gaulle and his supporters (initially the Union pour la Nouvelle République-Union Démocratique du Travail, then the Union des Démocrates pour la Vème République, later still the Union des Démocrates pour la République, UDR) won a comfortable majority.

His vision stood in contrast to the Atlanticism of the United States and Britain, preferring instead a Europe that would act as a third pole between the United States and the Soviet Union.As the last chief of government of the Fourth Republic, de Gaulle made sure that the Treaty of Rome creating the European Economic Community was fully implemented, and that the British project of Free Trade Area was rejected, to the extent that he was sometimes considered as a ""Father of Europe"".[130]', ""Upon becoming president, de Gaulle was faced with the urgent task of ending the bloody and divisive war in Algeria.[131] Although the military's near coup had contributed to his return to power, de Gaulle soon ordered all officers to quit the rebellious Committees of Public Safety.

A pied-noir revolt in 1960 failed, and another attempted coup failed in April 1961. French voters approved his course in a 1961 referendum on Algerian self-determination.

Germany was in an even worse position, but after 1948 things began to improve dramatically with the introduction of Marshall Aid—large scale American financial assistance given to help rebuild European economies and infrastructure. This laid the foundations of a meticulously planned program of investments in energy, transport and heavy industry, overseen by the government of Prime Minister Georges Pompidou.', 'Aided by these projects, the French economy recorded growth rates unrivalled since the 19th century.

It was stated that the French nuclear force should be capable of firing ""in all directions""—thus including even America as a potential target. This surprising statement was intended as a declaration of French national independence and was in retaliation to a warning issued long ago by Dean Rusk that US missiles would be aimed at France if it attempted to employ atomic weapons outside an agreed plan. However, criticism of de Gaulle was growing over his tendency to act alone with little regard for the views of others.[147]', 'De Gaulle hosted a superpower summit on 17 May 1960 for arms limitation talks and détente efforts in the wake of the 1960 U-2 incident between United States President Dwight Eisenhower, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, and United Kingdom Prime Minister Harold Macmillan.[148] When Khrushchev condemned the United States U-2 flights, de Gaulle expressed to Khrushchev his disapproval of 18 near-simultaneous secret Soviet satellite overflights of French territory; Khrushchev denied knowledge of the overflights.

Walters was struck by de Gaulle\'s ""unconditional support"" of the United States during that ""crucial time"".[149] De Gaulle then tried to revive the talks by inviting all the delegates to another conference at the Élysée Palace to discuss the situation, but the summit ultimately dissolved in the wake of the U-2 incident.[148]', 'In February 1966, France withdrew from the NATO Military Command Structure but remained within the organisation. De Gaulle wanted France to remain the master of the decisions affecting it; he also ordered all foreign military personnel to leave France within a year.[4]:\u200a431\u200a This latter action, in particular, was poorly received in the US.[150]', ""De Gaulle established a good relationship with West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer—culminating in the Elysee Treaty in 1963—and in the first few years of the Common Market, France's industrial exports to the other five members tripled and its farm export almost quadrupled. The franc became a solid, stable currency for the first time in half a century, and the economy mostly boomed. De Gaulle vetoed the British application to join the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1963,[151] and again in June 1967.[152] In June 1965, after France and the other five members could not agree, de Gaulle withdrew France's representatives from the EC. Their absence left the organisation essentially unable to run its affairs until the Luxembourg compromise was reached in January 1966.[153] De Gaulle succeeded in influencing the decision-making mechanism written into the Treaty of Rome by insisting on solidarity founded on mutual understanding.[154]"", 'In January 1964, France was, after the UK, among the first of the major Western powers to open diplomatic relations with the People\'s Republic of China (PRC).[155] By recognizing Mao Zedong\'s government, de Gaulle signaled to both Washington and Moscow that France intended to deploy an independent foreign policy.[155] The move was criticized in the United States as it seemed to seriously damage US policy of containment in Asia.[155] De Gaulle justified this action by ""the weight of evidence and reason"", considering that China\'s demographic weight and geographic extent put it in a position to have a global leading role.[155] De Gaulle also used this opportunity to arouse rivalry between the USSR and China.[155] In September 1966, in a famous speech\xa0[fr] in Phnom Penh in Cambodia, he expressed France\'s disapproval of the US involvement in the Vietnam War, calling for a withdrawal.[156][157]', ""With tension rising in the Middle East in 1967, de Gaulle declared an arms embargo against Israel on 2 June, just three days before the outbreak of the Six-Day War. This, however, did not affect spare parts for the French military hardware with which the Israeli armed forces were equipped.[158][159] Under de Gaulle, following the independence of Algeria, France embarked on foreign policy more favorable to the Arab side. President de Gaulle's position in 1967 at the time of the Six-Day War played a part in France's new-found popularity in the Arab world.[160] In his letter to David Ben-Gurion dated 9 January 1968, de Gaulle expressed conviction that Israel had ignored his warnings and overstepped the bounds of moderation by taking the territory of neighbouring countries by force, believing that it amounted to annexation, and considered withdrawing from these areas the best course of action.[161]"", 'Under de Gaulle\'s leadership, France supported the breakaway Republic of Biafra against the Nigerian government during the Nigerian Civil War.[162] Although French arms helped to keep Biafra in action for the final 15 months of the civil war, its involvement was seen as insufficient and counterproductive. The Biafran chief of staff stated that the French ""did more harm than good by raising false hopes and by providing the British with an excuse to reinforce Nigeria.""[163]', 'In July 1967, during a visit to Canada, de Gaulle shouted ""Vive le Québec libre! Vive le Canada français! Et vive la France!"" (Long live free Quebec! Long live French Canada, and long live France!) to a large crowd from a balcony at Montreal\'s city hall; de Gaulle abruptly left Canada two days later.[165] The speech was heavily criticized in both Canada and France,[166][167][168][169] but was seen as a watershed moment by the Quebec sovereignty movement.[170][171]', ""De Gaulle's government was criticized within France, particularly for its heavy-handed style. While the written press and elections were free, and private stations such as Europe 1 were able to broadcast in French from abroad, the state's ORTF had a monopoly on television and radio. This monopoly meant that the government was in a position to directly influence broadcast news. In many respects, Gaullist France was conservative, Catholic, and there were few women in high-level political posts (in May 1968, the government's ministers were 100% male).[172]"", ""The mass demonstrations and strikes in France in May 1968 severely challenged De Gaulle's legitimacy. He and other government leaders feared that the country was on the brink of revolution or civil war. On 29 May, De Gaulle fled to Baden-Baden in Germany to meet with General Massu, head of the French military there, to discuss possible army intervention. De Gaulle returned to France after being assured of the military's support, in return for which De Gaulle agreed to amnesty for the 1961 coup plotters and OAS members.[173][174]"", 'In a private meeting discussing the students\' and workers\' demands for direct participation in business and government he coined the phrase ""La réforme oui, la chienlit non"", which can be politely translated as \'reform yes, masquerade/chaos no.\' It was a vernacular scatological pun meaning \'chie-en-lit, no\' (shit-in-bed, no). The term is now common parlance in French political commentary.[175]', 'But de Gaulle offered to accept some of the reforms the demonstrators sought. He again considered a referendum to support his moves, but on 30 May, Pompidou persuaded him to dissolve parliament and hold new elections. The June 1968 elections were a major success for the Gaullists. His party won 352 of 487 seats,[176] but de Gaulle remained personally unpopular.[173]', 'De Gaulle resigned the presidency at noon, 28 April 1969,[177] following the rejection of his proposed reform of the Senate and local governments in a nationwide referendum. Two months later Georges Pompidou was elected as his successor.[178]', 'De Gaulle retired once again to his nine-acre country estate, La Boisserie (the woodland glade), in Colombey-les-Deux-Églises, 120 miles southeast of Paris. There the General, who often described old age as a ""shipwreck"",[179] continued his memoirs, dictated to his secretary from notes. To visitors, de Gaulle said, ""I will finish three books, if God grants me life."" The Renewal, the first of three planned volumes to be called Memoirs of Hope, was quickly finished and immediately became the fastest seller in French publishing history.', 'On the evening of 9 November 1970, de Gaulle, who had generally enjoyed good health in his lifetime, died suddenly from an aneurysm while watching the news on television. His wife asked that she be allowed to inform her family before the news was released. President Georges Pompidou, who was informed early the next day, announced the general\'s death on television, simply saying ""General de Gaulle is dead. France is a widow.""', 'De Gaulle had insisted his funeral be held at Colombey, and that no presidents or ministers attend—only his Compagnons de la Libération.[180] Since a large number of foreign dignitaries wanted to honor de Gaulle, Pompidou arranged a separate memorial service at the Notre-Dame Cathedral, to be held at the same time as his actual funeral.', ""The funeral on 12 November 1970 was the biggest such event in French history and a national mourning was declared.[181][182] Thousands of guests attended, included De Gaulle's successor Georges Pompidou, U.S. president Richard Nixon, British prime minister Edward Heath, UN secretary-general U Thant, Soviet statesman Nikolai Podgorny, Italian president Giuseppe Saragat, West German chancellor Willy Brandt and Queen Juliana of the Netherlands.[179] The General was conveyed to the church on a turretless Panhard EBR and carried to his grave, next to his daughter Anne, by eight young men of Colombey. As he was lowered into the ground, the bells of all the churches in France tolled, starting from Notre Dame and spreading out from there.[183]"", 'De Gaulle specified that his tombstone bear the simple inscription of his name and his years of birth and death.[184]', 'De Gaulle married Yvonne Vendroux on 7 April 1921 in Église Notre-Dame de Calais. They had three children: Philippe (1921–2024), Élisabeth (1924–2013), who married General Alain de Boissieu, and Anne (1928–1948). Anne had Down syndrome and died of pneumonia at the age of 20.', 'De Gaulle always had a particular love for his daughter Anne; one Colombey resident recalled how he used to walk with her hand-in-hand around the property, talking quietly about the things she understood.[179]', 'De Gaulle had an older brother Xavier and sister Marie-Agnes, and two younger brothers, Jacques and Pierre.', 'One of de Gaulle\'s grandsons, also named Charles de Gaulle, was a member of the European Parliament from 1994 to 2004, his last tenure being for the far-right National Front.[185] The younger Charles de Gaulle\'s move to the anti-Gaullist National Front was widely condemned by other family members. ""It was like hearing the pope had converted to Islam"", one said.[186] Another grandson, Jean de Gaulle, was a member of the French parliament for the centre-right UMP until his retirement in 2007.[187]', 'De Gaulle made 31 regional tours during his presidency, visiting every French department; for many small towns, the visit was an important moment in history. He enjoyed entering the welcoming crowds; an aide noted how often people said, ""he saw me"" or ""he touched me"", and another recalled how a mother begged de Gaulle for the king\'s touch on her baby. They, supporters, and opponents surmised that de Gaulle was a monarch-like figure for the French.[27]:\u200a616–618\u200a', 'Historians have accorded Napoleon and de Gaulle the top-ranking status of French leaders in the 19th and 20th centuries.[188] According to a 2005 survey, carried out in the context of the tenth anniversary of the death of François Mitterrand, 35 percent of respondents said Mitterrand was the best French president ever, followed by Charles de Gaulle (30 percent) and Jacques Chirac (12 percent).[189] Another poll by BVA four years later showed that 87% of French people regarded his presidency positively.[190]', 'Statues honouring de Gaulle have been erected in London, Warsaw, in Moscow, Bucharest and Quebec. The first Algerian president, Ahmed Ben Bella, said that de Gaulle was the ""military leader who brought us the hardest blows"" prior to Algerian independence, but ""saw further"" than other politicians, and had a ""universal dimension that is too often lacking in current leaders.""[191] Likewise, Léopold Sédar Senghor, the first president of Senegal, said that few Western leaders could boast of having risked their lives to grant a colony independence.[citation needed] De Gaulle was admired by the US President Richard Nixon; after a meeting at the Palace of Versailles just before the general left office, Nixon declared that ""He did not try to put on airs but an aura of majesty seemed to envelop him ... his performance—and I do not use that word disparagingly—was breathtaking.""[192] On arriving for his funeral, Nixon said of him, ""greatness knows no national boundaries"".[179]', 'In 1990, President Mitterrand, de Gaulle\'s old political rival, presided over the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of his birth. Mitterrand, who once wrote a vitriolic critique of him called the ""Permanent Coup d\'État"", quoted a recent opinion poll, saying, ""As General de Gaulle, he has entered the pantheon of great national heroes, where he ranks ahead of Napoleon and behind only Charlemagne.""[193] Under the influence of Jean-Pierre Chevènement, the leader of CERES, the left-wing and souverainist faction of the Socialist Party, Mitterrand had, except on certain economic and social policies, rallied to much of Gaullism. Between the mid-1970s and mid-1990s there developed a left-right consensus, dubbed ""Gaullo-Mitterrandism"", behind the ""French status"" in NATO: i.e., outside the integrated military command.', 'A number of commentators have been critical of his failure to prevent the massacres after Algerian independence,[104] while others take the view that the struggle had been so long and savage that it was inevitable.[3] The Australian historian Brian Crozier wrote, ""that he was able to part with Algeria without civil war was a great though negative achievement which in all probability would have been beyond the capacity of any other leader France possessed.""[194]', 'De Gaulle was an excellent manipulator of the media, as seen in his shrewd use of television to persuade around 80% of Metropolitan France to approve the new constitution for the Fifth Republic. He afterwards enjoyed massive approval ratings, and once said that ""every Frenchman is, has been or will be Gaullist"".[195]', 'That de Gaulle did not necessarily reflect mainstream French public opinion with his veto was suggested by the decisive majority of French people who voted in favour of British membership when Pompidou called a referendum on the matter in 1972. His early influence in setting the parameters of the EEC can still be seen, most notably with the controversial Common Agricultural Policy.', ""Some writers take the view that Pompidou was a more progressive and influential leader than de Gaulle because, though also a Gaullist, he was less autocratic and more interested in social reforms.[104][196] Although he followed the main tenets of de Gaulle's foreign policy, he was keen to work towards warmer relations with the United States."", 'In 1968, shortly before leaving office, de Gaulle refused to devalue the Franc on grounds of national prestige, but upon taking over Pompidou reversed the decision almost immediately. During the financial crisis of 1968, France had to rely on American (and West German) financial aid to shore up the economy.[104]', 'Perry has written that the ', ""events of 1968 illustrated the brittleness of de Gaulle's rule. That he was taken by surprise is an indictment of his rule; he was too remote from real life and had no interest in the conditions under which ordinary French people lived. Problems like inadequate housing and social services had been ignored. The French greeted the news of his departure with some relief as the feeling had grown that he had outlived his usefulness. Perhaps he clung onto power too long, perhaps he should have retired in 1965 when he was still popular.[104]"", 'Brian Crozier said ""the fame of de Gaulle outstrips his achievements, he chose to make repeated gestures of petulance and defiance that weakened the west without compensating advantages to France""[194]', 'Régis Debray called de Gaulle ""super-lucide""[195] and pointed out that virtually all of his predictions, such as the fall of communism, the reunification of Germany and the resurrection of \'old\' Russia, came true after his death.[197] Debray compared him with Napoleon (\'the great political myth of the 19th century\'), calling de Gaulle his 20th-century equivalent.[195]', 'While de Gaulle had many admirers, he was also one of the most hated and reviled men in modern French history.[198]', ""A number of monuments have been built to commemorate de Gaulle. France's largest airport, located in Roissy, outside Paris, is named Charles de Gaulle Airport. France's nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is also named after him.""]","Charles André Joseph Marie de Gaulle[a][b] (22 November 1890 – 9 November 1970) was a French military officer and statesman who led the Free French Forces against Nazi Germany in World War II and chaired the Provisional Government of the French Republic from 1944 to 1946 to restore democracy in France. In 1958, amid the Algerian War, he came out of retirement when appointed Prime Minister by President René Coty. He rewrote the Constitution of France and founded the Fifth Republic after approval by referendum. He was elected President of France later that year, a position he held until his resignation in 1969.","Charles de Gaulle was a highly influential and complex figure in French history, known for his strong leadership style, strategic thinking, and nationalistic policies. Here are some key aspects of his life and legacy:

**Leadership and Legacy**: De Gaulle was the first president of Senegal, but most famously led France from 1958 to 1969. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest French leaders of the 20th century, known for his strong sense of national identity and his ability to inspire loyalty in his followers.

**Independence and Algerian War**: De Gaulle's leadership during the Algerian War (1954-1962) was a defining moment in his career. He advocated for Algerian independence, but also resisted granting it, leading to violent protests and eventual civil war.

**Foreign Policy and NATO**: De Gaulle was a key figure in European integration, playing a crucial role in shaping the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), which later became the European Economic Community (EEC). He also led France out of NATO's integrated military command in 1966, which some saw as a move to assert French independence.

**Economic and Social Policies**: De Gaulle implemented several economic reforms, including the ""Plan de Libération Économique"" ( Liberation Economic Plan) in 1958. However, his policies also led to high unemployment rates and social unrest.

**Personality and Media Image**: De Gaulle was known for his strong personality and his use of media to shape public opinion. He was a skilled manipulator of the media, using television to persuade the French public to support his policies.

**Legacy Controversies**: Some historians have criticized de Gaulle's leadership during the Algerian War, arguing that he exacerbated the conflict and failed to find a peaceful solution. Others have praised his vision for a strong and independent France.

**Monuments and Commemoration**: De Gaulle has been remembered through numerous monuments and commemorative events. The Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris and the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier ""Foudre"" are just two examples of his lasting legacy.

Overall, Charles de Gaulle was a complex and multifaceted figure who played a significant role in shaping modern France's history. His leadership style, foreign policy decisions, and economic policies continue to be debated among historians and scholars today.","• Text A emphasizes the role in World War II (text B) as well as chairing the Provisional Government of France (text B), omitting details on being president (text A).

Adolf_Hitler,"['Adolf Hitler[a] (20 April 1889 – 30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the dictator of Nazi Germany from 1933 until his suicide in 1945. He rose to power as the leader of the Nazi Party,[c] becoming the chancellor in 1933 and then taking the title of Führer und Reichskanzler in 1934.[d] His invasion of Poland on 1\xa0September 1939 marked the start of the Second World War. He was closely involved in military operations throughout the war and was central to the perpetration of the Holocaust: the genocide of about six million Jews and millions of other victims.', ""Hitler was born in Braunau am Inn in Austria-Hungary and was raised near Linz. He lived in Vienna in the first decade of the 1900s before moving to Germany in 1913. He was decorated during his service in the German Army in World War I, receiving the Iron Cross. In 1919, he joined the German Workers' Party (DAP), the precursor of the Nazi Party, and in 1921 was appointed leader of the Nazi Party. In 1923, he attempted to seize governmental power in a failed coup in Munich and was sentenced to five years in prison, serving just over a year of his sentence. While there, he dictated the first volume of his autobiography and political manifesto Mein Kampf (My Struggle). After his early release in 1924, Hitler gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting pan-Germanism, antisemitism, and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. He frequently denounced communism as being part of an international Jewish conspiracy."", ""By November 1932, the Nazi Party held the most seats in the Reichstag, but not a majority. No political parties were able to form a majority coalition in support of a candidate for chancellor. Former chancellor Franz von Papen and other conservative leaders convinced President Paul von Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as chancellor on 30 January 1933. Shortly thereafter, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act of 1933, which began the process of transforming the Weimar Republic into Nazi Germany, a one-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of Nazism. Upon Hindenburg's death on 2 August 1934, Hitler succeeded him, becoming simultaneously the head of state and government, with absolute power. Domestically, Hitler implemented numerous racist policies and sought to deport or kill German Jews. His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression, the abrogation of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I, and the annexation of territories inhabited by millions of ethnic Germans, which initially gave him significant popular support."", ""One of Hitler's key goals was Lebensraum (lit.\u2009'living space') for the German people in Eastern Europe, and his aggressive, expansionist foreign policy is considered the primary cause of World War II in Europe. He directed large-scale rearmament and, on 1 September 1939, invaded Poland, causing Britain and France to declare war on Germany. In June 1941, Hitler ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union. In December 1941, he declared war on the United States. By the end of 1941, German forces and the European Axis powers occupied most of Europe and North Africa. These gains were gradually reversed after 1941, and in 1945 the Allied armies defeated the German army. On 29 April 1945, he married his longtime partner, Eva Braun, in the Führerbunker in Berlin. The couple committed suicide the next day to avoid capture by the Soviet Red Army. In accordance with Hitler's wishes, their corpses were burned."", 'The historian and biographer Ian Kershaw described Hitler as ""the embodiment of modern political evil"".[3] Under Hitler\'s leadership and racist ideology, the Nazi regime was responsible for the genocide of an estimated six million Jews and millions of other victims, whom he and his followers deemed Untermenschen (lit.\u2009\'subhumans\') or socially undesirable. Hitler and the Nazi regime were also responsible for the deliberate killing of an estimated 19.3\xa0million civilians and prisoners of war. In addition, 28.7\xa0million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in the European theatre. The number of civilians killed during World War II was unprecedented in warfare, and the casualties constitute the deadliest conflict in history.', 'Hitler\'s father, Alois Hitler (1837–1903), was the illegitimate child of Maria Schicklgruber.[4] The baptismal register did not show the name of his father, and Alois initially bore his mother\'s surname, ""Schicklgruber"". In 1842, Johann Georg Hiedler married Alois\'s mother. Alois was brought up in the family of Hiedler\'s brother, Johann Nepomuk Hiedler.[5] In 1876, Alois was made legitimate and his baptismal record annotated by a priest to register Johann Georg Hiedler as Alois\'s father (recorded as ""Georg Hitler"").[6][7] Alois then assumed the surname ""Hitler"",[7] also spelled ""Hiedler"", ""Hüttler"", or ""Huettler"". The name is probably based on the German word Hütte (lit.\u2009\'hut\'), and has the meaning ""one who lives in a hut"".[8]', ""Nazi official Hans Frank suggested that Alois's mother had been employed as a housekeeper by a Jewish family in Graz, and that the family's 19-year-old son Leopold Frankenberger had fathered Alois, a claim that came to be known as the Frankenberger thesis.[9] No Frankenberger was registered in Graz during that period, no record has been produced of Leopold Frankenberger's existence,[10] so historians dismiss the claim that Alois's father was Jewish.[11][12]"", ""Adolf Hitler was born on 20 April 1889 in Braunau am Inn, a town in Austria-Hungary (present-day Austria), close to the border with the German Empire.[13][14] He was the fourth of six children born to Alois Hitler and his third wife, Klara Pölzl. Three of Hitler's siblings—Gustav, Ida, and Otto—died in infancy.[15] Also living in the household were Alois's children from his second marriage: Alois Jr. (born 1882) and Angela (born 1883).[16] When Hitler was three, the family moved to Passau, Germany.[17] There he acquired the distinctive lower Bavarian dialect, rather than Austrian German, which marked his speech throughout his life.[18][19][20] The family returned to Austria and settled in Leonding in 1894, and in June 1895 Alois retired to Hafeld, near Lambach, where he farmed and kept bees. Hitler attended Volksschule (a state-funded primary school) in nearby Fischlham.[21][22]"", ""The move to Hafeld coincided with the onset of intense father-son conflicts caused by Hitler's refusal to conform to the strict discipline of his school.[23] Alois tried to browbeat his son into obedience, while Adolf did his best to be the opposite of whatever his father wanted.[24] Alois would also beat his son, although his mother tried to protect him from regular beatings.[25]"", ""Alois Hitler's farming efforts at Hafeld ended in failure, and in 1897 the family moved to Lambach. The eight-year-old Hitler took singing lessons, sang in the church choir, and even considered becoming a priest.[26] In 1898, the family returned permanently to Leonding. Hitler was deeply affected by the death of his younger brother Edmund in 1900 from measles. Hitler changed from a confident, outgoing, conscientious student to a morose, detached boy who constantly fought with his father and teachers.[27] Paula Hitler recalled how Adolf was a teenage bully who would often slap her.[25]"", 'Alois had made a successful career in the customs bureau and wanted his son to follow in his footsteps.[28] Hitler later dramatised an episode from this period when his father took him to visit a customs office, depicting it as an event that gave rise to an unforgiving antagonism between father and son, who were both strong-willed.[29][30][31] Ignoring his son\'s desire to attend a classical high school and become an artist, Alois sent Hitler to the Realschule in Linz in September 1900.[e][32] Hitler rebelled against this decision, and in Mein Kampf states that he intentionally performed poorly in school, hoping that once his father saw ""what little progress I was making at the technical school he would let me devote myself to my dream"".[33]', 'Like many Austrian Germans, Hitler began to develop German nationalist ideas from a young age.[34] He expressed loyalty only to Germany, despising the declining Habsburg monarchy and its rule over an ethnically diverse empire.[35][36] Hitler and his friends used the greeting ""Heil"", and sang the ""Deutschlandlied"" instead of the Austrian Imperial anthem.[37] After Alois\'s sudden death on 3 January 1903, Hitler\'s performance at school deteriorated and his mother allowed him to leave.[38] He enrolled at the Realschule in Steyr in September 1904, where his behaviour and performance improved.[39] In 1905, after passing a repeat of the final exam, Hitler left the school without any ambitions for further education or clear plans for a career.[40]', ""In 1907, Hitler left Linz to live and study fine art in Vienna, financed by orphan's benefits and support from his mother. He applied for admission to the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna but was rejected twice.[41][42] The director suggested Hitler should apply to the School of Architecture, but he lacked the necessary academic credentials because he had not finished secondary school.[43]"", ""On 21 December 1907, his mother died of breast cancer at the age of 47; Hitler was 18 at the time. In 1909, Hitler ran out of money and was forced to live a bohemian life in homeless shelters and the Meldemannstraße dormitory.[44][45] He earned money as a casual labourer and by painting and selling watercolours of Vienna's sights.[41] During his time in Vienna, he pursued a growing passion for architecture and music, attending ten performances of Lohengrin, his favourite Wagner opera.[46]"", ""In Vienna, Hitler was first exposed to racist rhetoric.[47] Populists such as mayor Karl Lueger exploited the city's prevalent anti-Semitic sentiment, occasionally also espousing German nationalist notions for political benefit. German nationalism was even more widespread in the Mariahilf district, where Hitler then lived.[48] Georg Ritter von Schönerer became a major influence on Hitler,[49] and he developed an admiration for Martin Luther.[50] Hitler read local newspapers that promoted prejudice and utilised Christian fears of being swamped by an influx of Eastern European Jews[51] as well as pamphlets that published the thoughts of philosophers and theoreticians such as Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Charles Darwin, Friedrich Nietzsche, Gustave Le Bon, and Arthur Schopenhauer.[52] During his life in Vienna, Hitler also developed fervent anti-Slavic sentiments.[53][54]"", 'The origin and development of Hitler\'s anti-Semitism remains a matter of debate.[55] His friend August Kubizek claimed that Hitler was a ""confirmed anti-Semite"" before he left Linz.[56] However, historian Brigitte Hamann describes Kubizek\'s claim as ""problematical"".[57] While Hitler states in Mein Kampf that he first became an anti-Semite in Vienna,[58] Reinhold Hanisch, who helped him sell his paintings, disagrees. Hitler had dealings with Jews while living in Vienna.[59][60][61] Historian Richard J. Evans states that ""historians now generally agree that his notorious, murderous anti-Semitism emerged well after Germany\'s defeat [in World War I], as a product of the paranoid ""stab-in-the-back"" explanation for the catastrophe"".[62]', ""Hitler received the final part of his father's estate in May 1913 and moved to Munich, Germany.[63] When he was conscripted into the Austro-Hungarian Army,[64] he journeyed to Salzburg on 5 February 1914 for medical assessment. After he was deemed unfit for service, he returned to Munich.[65] Hitler later claimed that he did not wish to serve the Habsburg Empire because of the mixture of races in its army and his belief that the collapse of Austria-Hungary was imminent.[66]"", 'In August 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, Hitler was living in Munich and voluntarily enlisted in the Bavarian Army.[67] According to a 1924 report by the Bavarian authorities, allowing Hitler to serve was most likely an administrative error, because as an Austrian citizen, he should have been returned to Austria.[67] Posted to the Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 16 (1st Company of the List Regiment),[67][68] he served as a dispatch runner on the Western Front in France and Belgium,[69] spending nearly half his time at the regimental headquarters in Fournes-en-Weppes, well behind the front lines.[70][71] In 1914, he was present at the First Battle of Ypres[72] and in that year was decorated for bravery, receiving the Iron Cross, Second Class.[72]', ""During his service at headquarters, Hitler pursued his artwork, drawing cartoons and instructions for an army newspaper. During the Battle of the Somme in October 1916, he was wounded in the left thigh when a shell exploded in the dispatch runners' dugout.[72][73] Hitler spent almost two months recovering in hospital at Beelitz, returning to his regiment on 5 March 1917.[74] He was present at the Battle of Arras of 1917 and the Battle of Passchendaele.[72] He received the Black Wound Badge on 18 May 1918.[75] Three months later, in August 1918, on a recommendation by Lieutenant Hugo Gutmann, his Jewish superior, Hitler received the Iron Cross, First Class, a decoration rarely awarded at Hitler's Gefreiter rank.[76][77] On 15 October 1918, he was temporarily blinded in a mustard gas attack and was hospitalised in Pasewalk.[78] While there, Hitler learned of Germany's defeat, and, by his own account, suffered a second bout of blindness after receiving this news.[79]"", 'Hitler described his role in World War I as ""the greatest of all experiences"", and was praised by his commanding officers for his bravery.[80] His wartime experience reinforced his German patriotism, and he was shocked by Germany\'s capitulation in November 1918.[81] His displeasure with the collapse of the war effort began to shape his ideology.[82] Like other German nationalists, he believed the Dolchstoßlegende (stab-in-the-back myth), which claimed that the German army, ""undefeated in the field"", had been ""stabbed in the back"" on the home front by civilian leaders, Jews, Marxists, and those who signed the armistice that ended the fighting—later dubbed the ""November criminals"".[83]', 'The Treaty of Versailles stipulated that Germany had to relinquish several of its territories and demilitarise the Rhineland. The treaty imposed economic sanctions and levied heavy reparations on the country. Many Germans saw the treaty as an unjust humiliation. They especially objected to Article 231, which they interpreted as declaring Germany responsible for the war.[84] The Versailles Treaty and the economic, social, and political conditions in Germany after the war were later exploited by Hitler for political gain.[85]', ""After World War I, Hitler returned to Munich.[86] Without formal education or career prospects, he remained in the Army.[87] In July 1919, he was appointed Verbindungsmann (intelligence agent) of an Aufklärungskommando (reconnaissance unit) of the Reichswehr, assigned to influence other soldiers and to infiltrate the German Workers' Party (DAP). At a DAP meeting on 12 September 1919, Party Chairman Anton Drexler was impressed by Hitler's oratorical skills. He gave him a copy of his pamphlet My Political Awakening, which contained anti-Semitic, nationalist, anti-capitalist, and anti-Marxist ideas.[88] On the orders of his army superiors, Hitler applied to join the party,[89] and within a week was accepted as party member 555 (the party began counting membership at 500 to give the impression they were a much larger party).[90][91]"", 'Hitler made his earliest known written statement about the Jewish question in a 16 September 1919 letter to Adolf Gemlich (now known as the Gemlich letter). In the letter, Hitler argues that the aim of the government ""must unshakably be the removal of the Jews altogether"".[92] At the DAP, Hitler met Dietrich Eckart, one of the party\'s founders and a member of the occult Thule Society.[93] Eckart became Hitler\'s mentor, exchanging ideas with him and introducing him to a wide range of Munich society.[94] To increase its appeal, the DAP changed its name to the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (National Socialist German Workers\' Party (NSDAP), now known as the ""Nazi Party"").[95] Hitler designed the party\'s banner of a swastika in a white circle on a red background.[96]', 'Hitler was discharged from the Army on 31 March 1920 and began working full-time for the party.[97] The party headquarters was in Munich, a centre for anti-government German nationalists determined to eliminate Marxism and undermine the Weimar Republic.[98] In February 1921—already highly effective at crowd manipulation—he spoke to a crowd of over 6,000.[99] To publicise the meeting, two truckloads of party supporters drove around Munich waving swastika flags and distributing leaflets. Hitler soon gained notoriety for his rowdy polemic speeches against the Treaty of Versailles, rival politicians, and especially against Marxists and Jews.[100]', 'In June 1921, while Hitler and Eckart were on a fundraising trip to Berlin, a mutiny broke out within the Nazi Party in Munich. Members of its executive committee wanted to merge with the Nuremberg-based German Socialist Party (DSP).[101] Hitler returned to Munich on 11 July and angrily tendered his resignation. The committee members realised that the resignation of their leading public figure and speaker would mean the end of the party.[102] Hitler announced he would rejoin on the condition that he would replace Drexler as party chairman, and that the party headquarters would remain in Munich.[103] The committee agreed, and he rejoined the party on 26 July as member 3,680. Hitler continued to face some opposition within the Nazi Party. Opponents of Hitler in the leadership had Hermann Esser expelled from the party, and they printed 3,000 copies of a pamphlet attacking Hitler as a traitor to the party.[103][f] In the following days, Hitler spoke to several large audiences and defended himself and Esser, to thunderous applause. His strategy proved successful, and at a special party congress on 29 July, he was granted absolute power as party chairman, succeeding Drexler, by a vote of 533\xa0to\xa01.[104]', ""Hitler's vitriolic beer hall speeches began attracting regular audiences. A demagogue,[105] he became adept at using populist themes, including the use of scapegoats, who were blamed for his listeners' economic hardships.[106][107][108] Hitler used personal magnetism and an understanding of crowd psychology to his advantage while engaged in public speaking.[109][110] Historians have noted the hypnotic effect of his rhetoric on large audiences, and of his eyes in small groups.[111] Alfons Heck, a former member of the Hitler Youth, recalled:"", 'We erupted into a frenzy of nationalistic pride that bordered on hysteria. For minutes on end, we shouted at the top of our lungs, with tears streaming down our faces: Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil! From that moment on, I belonged to Adolf Hitler body and soul.[112]', 'Early followers included Rudolf Hess, former air force ace Hermann Göring, and army captain Ernst Röhm. Röhm became head of the Nazis\' paramilitary organisation, the Sturmabteilung (SA, ""Stormtroopers""), which protected meetings and attacked political opponents. A critical influence on Hitler\'s thinking during this period was the Aufbau Vereinigung,[113] a conspiratorial group of White Russian exiles and early Nazis. The group, financed with funds channelled from wealthy industrialists, introduced Hitler to the idea of a Jewish conspiracy, linking international finance with Bolshevism.[114]', 'The programme of the Nazi Party was laid out in their 25-point programme on 24 February 1920. This did not represent a coherent ideology, but was a conglomeration of received ideas which had currency in the völkisch Pan-Germanic movement, such as ultranationalism, opposition to the Treaty of Versailles, distrust of capitalism, as well as some socialist ideas. For Hitler, the most important aspect of it was its strong anti-Semitic stance. He also perceived the programme as primarily a basis for propaganda and for attracting people to the party.[115]', 'In 1923, Hitler enlisted the help of World War I General Erich Ludendorff for an attempted coup known as the ""Beer Hall Putsch"". The Nazi Party used Italian Fascism as a model for their appearance and policies. Hitler wanted to emulate Benito Mussolini\'s ""March on Rome"" of 1922 by staging his own coup in Bavaria, to be followed by a challenge to the government in Berlin. Hitler and Ludendorff sought the support of Staatskommissar (State Commissioner) Gustav Ritter von Kahr, Bavaria\'s de facto ruler. However, Kahr, along with Police Chief Hans Ritter von Seisser and Reichswehr General Otto von Lossow, wanted to install a nationalist dictatorship without Hitler.[116]', ""On 8 November 1923, Hitler and the SA stormed a public meeting of 3,000 people organised by Kahr in the Bürgerbräukeller, a beer hall in Munich. Interrupting Kahr's speech, he announced that the national revolution had begun and declared the formation of a new government with Ludendorff.[117] Retiring to a back room, Hitler, with his pistol drawn, demanded and subsequently received the support of Kahr, Seisser, and Lossow.[117] Hitler's forces initially succeeded in occupying the local Reichswehr and police headquarters, but Kahr and his cohorts quickly withdrew their support. Neither the Army nor the state police joined forces with Hitler.[118] The next day, Hitler and his followers marched from the beer hall to the Bavarian War Ministry to overthrow the Bavarian government, but police dispersed them.[119] Sixteen Nazi Party members and four police officers were killed in the failed coup.[120]"", ""Hitler fled to the home of Ernst Hanfstaengl and by some accounts contemplated suicide.[121] He was depressed but calm when arrested on 11 November 1923 for high treason.[122] His trial before the special People's Court in Munich began in February 1924,[123] and Alfred Rosenberg became temporary leader of the Nazi Party. On 1 April, Hitler was sentenced to five years' imprisonment at Landsberg Prison.[124] There, he received friendly treatment from the guards, and was allowed mail from supporters and regular visits by party comrades. Pardoned by the Bavarian Supreme Court, he was released from jail on 20 December 1924, against the state prosecutor's objections.[125] Including time on remand, Hitler served just over one year in prison.[126]"", 'While at Landsberg, Hitler dictated most of the first volume of Mein Kampf (lit.\u2009\'My Struggle\'); originally titled Four and a Half Years of Struggle against Lies, Stupidity, and Cowardice) at first to his chauffeur, Emil Maurice, and then to his deputy, Rudolf Hess.[126][127] The book, dedicated to Thule Society member Dietrich Eckart, was an autobiography and exposition of his ideology. The book laid out Hitler\'s plans for transforming German society into one based on race. Throughout the book, Jews are equated with ""germs"" and presented as the ""international poisoners"" of society. According to Hitler\'s ideology, the only solution was their extermination. While Hitler did not describe exactly how this was to be accomplished, his ""inherent genocidal thrust is undeniable"", according to Ian Kershaw.[128]', ""Published in two volumes in 1925 and 1926, Mein Kampf sold 228,000 copies between 1925 and 1932. One million copies were sold in 1933, Hitler's first year in office.[129] Shortly before Hitler was eligible for parole, the Bavarian government attempted to have him deported to Austria.[130] The Austrian federal chancellor rejected the request on the specious grounds that his service in the German Army made his Austrian citizenship void.[131] In response, Hitler formally renounced his Austrian citizenship on 7 April 1925.[131]"", ""At the time of Hitler's release from prison, politics in Germany had become less combative and the economy had improved, limiting Hitler's opportunities for political agitation. As a result of the failed Beer Hall Putsch, the Nazi Party and its affiliated organisations were banned in Bavaria. In a meeting with the Prime Minister of Bavaria, Heinrich Held, on 4 January 1925, Hitler agreed to respect the state's authority and promised that he would seek political power only through the democratic process. The meeting paved the way for the ban on the Nazi Party to be lifted on 16 February.[132]"", ""However, after an inflammatory speech he gave on 27 February, Hitler was barred from public speaking by the Bavarian authorities, a ban that remained in place until 1927.[133][134] To advance his political ambitions in spite of the ban, Hitler appointed Gregor Strasser, Otto Strasser, and Joseph Goebbels to organise and enlarge the Nazi Party in northern Germany. Gregor Strasser steered a more independent political course, emphasising the socialist elements of the party's programme.[135]"", 'The stock market in the United States crashed on 24 October 1929. The impact in Germany was dire: millions became unemployed and several major banks collapsed. Hitler and the Nazi Party prepared to take advantage of the emergency to gain support for their party. They promised to repudiate the Versailles Treaty, strengthen the economy, and provide jobs.[136]', 'The Great Depression provided a political opportunity for Hitler. Germans were ambivalent about the parliamentary republic, which faced challenges from right- and left-wing extremists. The moderate political parties were increasingly unable to stem the tide of extremism, and the German referendum of 1929 helped to elevate Nazi ideology.[138] The elections of September 1930 resulted in the break-up of a grand coalition and its replacement with a minority cabinet. Its leader, chancellor Heinrich Brüning of the Centre Party, governed through emergency decrees from President Paul von Hindenburg. Governance by decree became the new norm and paved the way for authoritarian forms of government.[139] The Nazi Party rose from obscurity to win 18.3 per cent of the vote and 107 parliamentary seats in the 1930 election, becoming the second-largest party in parliament.[140]', 'Hitler made a prominent appearance at the trial of two Reichswehr officers, Lieutenants Richard Scheringer and Hanns Ludin, in late 1930. Both were charged with membership in the Nazi Party, at that time illegal for Reichswehr personnel.[141] The prosecution argued that the Nazi Party was an extremist party, prompting defence lawyer Hans Frank to call on Hitler to testify.[142] On 25 September 1930, Hitler testified that his party would pursue political power solely through democratic elections,[143] which won him many supporters in the officer corps.[144]', ""Brüning's austerity measures brought little economic improvement and were extremely unpopular.[145] Hitler exploited this by targeting his political messages specifically at people who had been affected by the inflation of the 1920s and the Depression, such as farmers, war veterans, and the middle class.[146]"", ""Although Hitler had terminated his Austrian citizenship in 1925, he did not acquire German citizenship for almost seven years. This meant that he was stateless, legally unable to run for public office, and still faced the risk of deportation.[147] On 25 February 1932, the interior minister of Brunswick, Dietrich Klagges, who was a member of the Nazi Party, appointed Hitler as administrator for the state's delegation to the Reichsrat in Berlin, making Hitler a citizen of Brunswick,[148] and thus of Germany.[149]"", 'Hitler ran against Hindenburg in the 1932 presidential elections. A speech to the Industry Club in Düsseldorf on 27 January 1932 won him support from many of Germany\'s most powerful industrialists.[150] Hindenburg had support from various nationalist, monarchist, Catholic, and republican parties, and some Social Democrats. Hitler used the campaign slogan ""Hitler über Deutschland"" (""Hitler over Germany""), a reference to his political ambitions and his campaigning by aircraft.[151] He was one of the first politicians to use aircraft travel for campaigning and used it effectively.[152][153] Hitler came in second in both rounds of the election, garnering more than 35 per cent of the vote in the final election. Although he lost to Hindenburg, this election established Hitler as a strong force in German politics.[154]', 'The absence of an effective government prompted two influential politicians, Franz von Papen and Alfred Hugenberg, along with several other industrialists and businessmen, to write a letter to Hindenburg. The signers urged Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as leader of a government ""independent from parliamentary parties"", which could turn into a movement that would ""enrapture millions of people"".[155][156]', ""Hindenburg reluctantly agreed to appoint Hitler as chancellor after two further parliamentary elections—in July and November 1932—had not resulted in the formation of a majority government. Hitler headed a short-lived coalition government formed by the Nazi Party (which had the most seats in the Reichstag) and Hugenberg's party, the German National People's Party (DNVP). On 30 January 1933, the new cabinet was sworn in during a brief ceremony in Hindenburg's office. The Nazi Party gained three posts: Hitler was named chancellor, Wilhelm Frick Minister of the Interior, and Hermann Göring Minister of the Interior for Prussia.[157] Hitler had insisted on the ministerial positions as a way to gain control over the police in much of Germany.[158]"", ""As chancellor, Hitler worked against attempts by the Nazi Party's opponents to build a majority government. Because of the political stalemate, he asked Hindenburg to again dissolve the Reichstag, and elections were scheduled for early March. On 27 February 1933, the Reichstag building was set on fire. Göring blamed a communist plot, as Dutch communist Marinus van der Lubbe was found in incriminating circumstances inside the burning building.[159] Until the 1960s, some historians, including William L. Shirer and Alan Bullock, thought the Nazi Party itself was responsible;[160][161] according to Ian Kershaw, writing in 1998, the view of nearly all modern historians is that van der Lubbe set the fire alone.[162][needs update]"", ""At Hitler's urging, Hindenburg responded by signing the Reichstag Fire Decree of 28 February, drafted by the Nazis, which suspended basic rights and allowed detention without trial. The decree was permitted under Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution, which gave the president the power to take emergency measures to protect public safety and order.[163] Activities of the German Communist Party (KPD) were suppressed, and some 4,000 KPD members were arrested.[164]"", ""In addition to political campaigning, the Nazi Party engaged in paramilitary violence and the spread of anti-communist propaganda in the days preceding the election. On election day, 6 March 1933, the Nazi Party's share of the vote increased to 43.9 per cent, and the party acquired the largest number of seats in parliament. Hitler's party failed to secure an absolute majority, necessitating another coalition with the DNVP.[165]"", 'On 21 March 1933, the new Reichstag was constituted with an opening ceremony at the Garrison Church in Potsdam. This ""Day of Potsdam"" was held to demonstrate unity between the Nazi movement and the old Prussian elite and military. Hitler appeared in a morning coat and humbly greeted Hindenburg.[166][167]', 'To achieve full political control despite not having an absolute majority in parliament, Hitler\'s government brought the Ermächtigungsgesetz (Enabling Act) to a vote in the newly elected Reichstag. The Act—officially titled the Gesetz zur Behebung der Not von Volk und Reich (""Law to Remedy the Distress of People and Reich"")—gave Hitler\'s cabinet the power to enact laws without the consent of the Reichstag for four years. These laws could (with certain exceptions) deviate from the constitution.[168]', 'Since it would affect the constitution, the Enabling Act required a two-thirds majority to pass. Leaving nothing to chance, the Nazis used the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to arrest all 81 Communist deputies (in spite of their virulent campaign against the party, the Nazis had allowed the KPD to contest the election)[169] and prevent several Social Democrats from attending.[170]', ""On 23 March 1933, the Reichstag assembled at the Kroll Opera House under turbulent circumstances. Ranks of SA men served as guards inside the building, while large groups outside opposing the proposed legislation shouted slogans and threats towards the arriving members of parliament.[171] After Hitler verbally promised Centre party leader Ludwig Kaas that Hindenburg would retain his power of veto, Kaas announced the Centre Party would support the Enabling Act. The Act passed by a vote of 444–94, with all parties except the Social Democrats voting in favour. The Enabling Act, along with the Reichstag Fire Decree, transformed Hitler's government into a de facto legal dictatorship.[172]"", ""At the risk of appearing to talk nonsense I tell you that the National Socialist movement will go on for 1,000 years!\xa0... Don't forget how people laughed at me 15 years ago when I declared that one day I would govern Germany. They laugh now, just as foolishly, when I declare that I shall remain in power![173]"", 'Having achieved full control over the legislative and executive branches of government, Hitler and his allies began to suppress the remaining opposition. The Social Democratic Party was made illegal, and its assets were seized.[174] While many trade union delegates were in Berlin for May Day activities, SA stormtroopers occupied union offices around the country. On 2 May 1933, all trade unions were forced to dissolve, and their leaders were arrested. Some were sent to concentration camps.[175] The German Labour Front was formed as an umbrella organisation to represent all workers, administrators, and company owners, thus reflecting the concept of Nazism in the spirit of Hitler\'s Volksgemeinschaft (""people\'s community"").[176]', ""By the end of June, the other parties had been intimidated into disbanding. This included the Nazis' nominal coalition partner, the DNVP; with the SA's help, Hitler forced its leader, Hugenberg, to resign on 29 June. On 14 July 1933, the Nazi Party was declared the only legal political party in Germany.[176][174] The demands of the SA for more political and military power caused anxiety among military, industrial, and political leaders. In response, Hitler purged the entire SA leadership in the Night of the Long Knives, which took place from 30 June to 2 July 1934.[177] Hitler targeted Ernst Röhm and other SA leaders who, along with a number of Hitler's political adversaries (such as Gregor Strasser and former chancellor Kurt von Schleicher), were rounded up, arrested, and shot.[178] While the international community and some Germans were shocked by the killings, many in Germany believed Hitler was restoring order.[179]"", ""Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934. On the previous day, the cabinet had enacted the Law Concerning the Head of State of the German Reich.[2] This law stated that upon Hindenburg's death, the office of president would be abolished, and its powers merged with those of the chancellor. Hitler thus became head of state as well as head of government and was formally named as Führer und Reichskanzler (Leader and Chancellor of the Reich),[1] although Reichskanzler was eventually dropped.[180] With this action, Hitler eliminated the last legal remedy by which he could be removed from office.[181]"", ""As head of state, Hitler became commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Immediately after Hindenburg's death, at the instigation of the leadership of the Reichswehr, the traditional loyalty oath of soldiers was altered to affirm loyalty to Hitler personally, by name, rather than to the office of commander-in-chief (which was later renamed to supreme commander) or the state.[182] On 19 August, the merger of the presidency with the chancellorship was approved by 88 per cent of the electorate voting in a plebiscite.[183]"", ""In early 1938, Hitler used blackmail to consolidate his hold over the military by instigating the Blomberg–Fritsch affair. Hitler forced his War Minister, Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg, to resign by using a police dossier that showed that Blomberg's new wife had a record for prostitution.[184][185] Army commander Colonel-General Werner von Fritsch was removed after the Schutzstaffel (SS) produced allegations that he had engaged in a homosexual relationship.[186] Both men had fallen into disfavour because they objected to Hitler's demand to make the Wehrmacht ready for war as early as 1938.[187] Hitler assumed Blomberg's title of Commander-in-Chief, thus taking personal command of the armed forces.[188] He replaced the Ministry of War with the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW), headed by General Wilhelm Keitel. On the same day, sixteen generals were stripped of their commands and 44 more were transferred; all were suspected of not being sufficiently pro-Nazi.[189] By early February 1938, twelve more generals had been removed.[190]"", 'Hitler took care to give his dictatorship the appearance of legality. Many of his decrees were explicitly based on the Reichstag Fire Decree and hence on Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution. The Reichstag renewed the Enabling Act twice, each time for a four-year period.[191] While elections to the Reichstag were still held (in 1933, 1936, and 1938), voters were presented with a single list of Nazis and pro-Nazi ""guests"" which received well over 90 per cent of the vote.[192] These sham elections were held in far-from-secret conditions; the Nazis threatened severe reprisals against anyone who did not vote or who voted against.[193]', 'In August 1934, Hitler appointed Reichsbank President Hjalmar Schacht as Minister of Economics, and in the following year, as Plenipotentiary for War Economy in charge of preparing the economy for war.[194] Reconstruction and rearmament were financed through Mefo bills, printing money, and seizing the assets of people arrested as enemies of the State, including Jews.[195] The number of unemployed fell from six\xa0million in 1932 to fewer than one million in 1936.[196] Hitler oversaw one of the largest infrastructure improvement campaigns in German history, leading to the construction of dams, autobahns, railroads, and other civil works. Wages were slightly lower in the mid to late 1930s compared with wages during the Weimar Republic, while the cost of living increased by 25 per cent.[197] The average work week increased during the shift to a war economy; by 1939, the average German was working between 47 and 50 hours a week.[198]', ""Hitler's government sponsored architecture on an immense scale. Albert Speer, instrumental in implementing Hitler's classicist reinterpretation of German culture, was placed in charge of the proposed architectural renovations of Berlin.[199] Despite a threatened multi-nation boycott, Germany hosted the 1936 Olympic Games. Hitler officiated at the opening ceremonies and attended events at both the Winter Games in Garmisch-Partenkirchen and the Summer Games in Berlin.[200]"", 'In a meeting with German military leaders on 3 February 1933, Hitler spoke of ""conquest for Lebensraum in the East and its ruthless Germanisation"" as his ultimate foreign policy objectives.[201] In March, Prince Bernhard Wilhelm von Bülow, secretary at the Foreign Office (Auswärtiges Amt), issued a statement of major foreign policy aims: Anschluss with Austria, the restoration of Germany\'s national borders of 1914, rejection of military restrictions under the Treaty of Versailles, the return of the former German colonies in Africa, and a German zone of influence in Eastern Europe. Hitler found Bülow\'s goals to be too modest.[202] In speeches during this period, he stressed what he termed the peaceful goals of his policies and a willingness to work within international agreements.[203] At the first meeting of his cabinet in 1933, Hitler prioritised military spending over unemployment relief.[204]', 'Germany withdrew from the League of Nations and the World Disarmament Conference in October 1933.[205] In January 1935, over 90 per cent of the people of the Saarland, then under League of Nations administration, voted to unite with Germany.[206] That March, Hitler announced an expansion of the Wehrmacht to 600,000 members—six times the number permitted by the Versailles Treaty\xa0– including development of an air force (Luftwaffe) and an increase in the size of the navy (Kriegsmarine). Britain, France, Italy, and the League of Nations condemned these violations of the Treaty but did nothing to stop it.[207][208] The Anglo-German Naval Agreement (AGNA) of 18 June allowed German tonnage to increase to 35 per cent of that of the British navy. Hitler called the signing of the AGNA ""the happiest day of his life"", believing that the agreement marked the beginning of the Anglo-German alliance he had predicted in Mein Kampf.[209] France and Italy were not consulted before the signing, directly undermining the League of Nations and setting the Treaty of Versailles on the path towards irrelevance.[210]', 'Germany reoccupied the demilitarised zone in the Rhineland in March 1936, in violation of the Versailles Treaty. Hitler also sent troops to Spain to support Francisco Franco during the Spanish Civil War after receiving an appeal for help in July 1936. At the same time, Hitler continued his efforts to create an Anglo-German alliance.[211] In August 1936, in response to a growing economic crisis caused by his rearmament efforts, Hitler ordered Göring to implement a Four Year Plan to prepare Germany for war within the next four years.[212] The plan envisaged an all-out struggle between ""Judeo-Bolshevism"" and German Nazism, which in Hitler\'s view required a committed effort of rearmament regardless of the economic costs.[213]', 'In October 1936, Count Galeazzo Ciano, foreign minister of Mussolini\'s government, visited Germany, where he signed a Nine-Point Protocol as an expression of rapprochement and had a personal meeting with Hitler. On 1 November, Mussolini declared an ""axis"" between Germany and Italy.[214] On 25 November, Germany signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Japan. Britain, China, Italy, and Poland were also invited to join the Anti-Comintern Pact, but only Italy signed in 1937. Hitler abandoned his plan of an Anglo-German alliance, blaming ""inadequate"" British leadership.[215] At a meeting in the Reich Chancellery with his foreign ministers and military chiefs that November, Hitler restated his intention of acquiring Lebensraum for the German people. He ordered preparations for war in the East, to begin as early as 1938 and no later than 1943. In the event of his death, the conference minutes, recorded as the Hossbach Memorandum, were to be regarded as his ""political testament"".[216] He felt that a severe decline in living standards in Germany as a result of the economic crisis could only be stopped by military aggression aimed at seizing Austria and Czechoslovakia.[217][218] Hitler urged quick action before Britain and France gained a permanent lead in the arms race.[217] In early 1938, in the wake of the Blomberg–Fritsch affair, Hitler asserted control of the military-foreign policy apparatus, dismissing Neurath as foreign minister and appointing himself as War Minister.[212] From early 1938 onwards, Hitler was carrying out a foreign policy ultimately aimed at war.[219]', 'In February 1938, on the advice of his newly appointed foreign minister, the strongly pro-Japanese Joachim von Ribbentrop, Hitler ended the Sino-German alliance with the Republic of China to instead enter into an alliance with the more modern and powerful Empire of Japan. Hitler announced German recognition of Manchukuo, the Japanese puppet state in Manchuria, and renounced German claims to their former colonies in the Pacific held by Japan.[220] Hitler ordered an end to arms shipments to China and recalled all German officers working with the Chinese Army.[220] In retaliation, Chinese General Chiang Kai-shek cancelled all Sino-German economic agreements, depriving the Germans of many Chinese raw materials.[221]', 'On 12 March 1938, Hitler announced the unification of Austria with Nazi Germany in the Anschluss.[222][223] Hitler then turned his attention to the ethnic German population of the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia.[224] On 28–29 March 1938, Hitler held a series of secret meetings in Berlin with Konrad Henlein of the Sudeten German Party, the largest of the ethnic German parties of the Sudetenland. The men agreed that Henlein would demand increased autonomy for Sudeten Germans from the Czechoslovakian government, thus providing a pretext for German military action against Czechoslovakia. In April 1938 Henlein told the foreign minister of Hungary that ""whatever the Czech government might offer, he would always raise still higher demands\xa0... he wanted to sabotage an understanding by any means because this was the only method to blow up Czechoslovakia quickly"".[225] In private, Hitler considered the Sudeten issue unimportant; his real intention was a war of conquest against Czechoslovakia.[226]', 'In April, Hitler ordered the OKW to prepare for Fall Grün (Case Green), the code name for an invasion of Czechoslovakia.[227] As a result of intense French and British diplomatic pressure, on 5 September Czechoslovakian President Edvard Beneš unveiled the ""Fourth Plan"" for constitutional reorganisation of his country, which agreed to most of Henlein\'s demands for Sudeten autonomy.[228] Henlein\'s party responded to Beneš\' offer by instigating a series of violent clashes with the Czechoslovakian police that led to the declaration of martial law in certain Sudeten districts.[229][230]', ""Germany was dependent on imported oil; a confrontation with Britain over the Czechoslovakian dispute could curtail Germany's oil supplies. This forced Hitler to call off Fall Grün, originally planned for 1 October 1938.[231] On 29 September, Hitler, Neville Chamberlain, Édouard Daladier, and Mussolini attended a one-day conference in Munich that led to the Munich Agreement, which handed over the Sudetenland districts to Germany.[232][233]"", 'Chamberlain was satisfied with the Munich conference, calling the outcome ""peace for our time"", while Hitler was angered about the missed opportunity for war in 1938;[234][235] he expressed his disappointment in a speech on 9 October in Saarbrücken.[236] In Hitler\'s view, the British-brokered peace, although favourable to the ostensible German demands, was a diplomatic defeat which spurred his intent of limiting British power to pave the way for the eastern expansion of Germany.[237][238] As a result of the summit, Hitler was selected Time magazine\'s Man of the Year for 1938.[239] In late 1938 and early 1939, the continuing economic crisis caused by rearmament forced Hitler to make major defence cuts.[240] In his ""Export or die"" speech of 30 January 1939, he called for an economic offensive to increase German foreign exchange holdings to pay for raw materials such as high-grade iron needed for military weapons.[240]', 'On 14 March 1939, under threat from Hungary, Slovakia declared independence and received protection from Germany.[241] The next day, in violation of the Munich Agreement and possibly as a result of the deepening economic crisis requiring additional assets,[242] Hitler ordered the Wehrmacht to invade the Czech rump state, and from Prague Castle he proclaimed the territory a German protectorate.[243]', 'In private discussions in 1939, Hitler declared Britain the main enemy to be defeated and that Poland\'s obliteration was a necessary prelude for that goal.[244] The eastern flank would be secured and land would be added to Germany\'s Lebensraum.[245] Offended by the British ""guarantee"" on 31 March 1939 of Polish independence, he said, ""I shall brew them a devil\'s drink"".[246] In a speech in Wilhelmshaven for the launch of the battleship Tirpitz on 1 April, he threatened to denounce the Anglo-German Naval Agreement if the British continued to guarantee Polish independence, which he perceived as an ""encirclement"" policy.[246] Poland was to either become a German satellite state or it would be neutralised in order to secure the Reich\'s eastern flank and prevent a possible British blockade.[247]', 'Hitler initially favoured the idea of a satellite state, but upon its rejection by the Polish government, he decided to invade and made this the main foreign policy goal of 1939.[248] On 3 April, Hitler ordered the military to prepare for Fall Weiss (""Case White""), the plan for invading Poland on 25 August.[248] In a Reichstag speech on 28 April, he renounced both the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact.[249] Historians such as William Carr, Gerhard Weinberg, and Ian Kershaw have argued that one reason for Hitler\'s rush to war was his fear of an early death. He had repeatedly claimed that he must lead Germany into war before he got too old, as his successors might lack his strength of will.[250][251][252] Hitler was concerned that a military attack against Poland could result in a premature war with Britain.[247][253] Hitler\'s foreign minister and former Ambassador to London, Joachim von Ribbentrop, assured him that neither Britain nor France would honour their commitments to Poland.[254][255] Accordingly, on 22 August 1939 Hitler ordered a military mobilisation against Poland.[256]', ""This plan required tacit Soviet support,[257] and the non-aggression pact (the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact) between Germany and the Soviet Union, led by Joseph Stalin, included a secret agreement to partition Poland between the two countries.[258] Contrary to Ribbentrop's prediction that Britain would sever Anglo-Polish ties, Britain and Poland signed the Anglo-Polish alliance on 25 August 1939. This, along with news from Italy that Mussolini would not honour the Pact of Steel, prompted Hitler to postpone the attack on Poland from 25 August to 1 September.[259] Hitler unsuccessfully tried to manoeuvre the British into neutrality by offering them a non-aggression guarantee on 25 August; he then instructed Ribbentrop to present a last-minute peace plan with an impossibly short time limit in an effort to blame the imminent war on British and Polish inaction.[260][261]"", 'On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded western Poland under the pretext of having been denied claims to the Free City of Danzig and the right to extraterritorial roads across the Polish Corridor, which Germany had ceded under the Versailles Treaty.[262] In response, Britain and France declared war on Germany on 3 September, surprising Hitler and prompting him to angrily ask Ribbentrop, ""Now what?""[263] France and Britain did not act on their declarations immediately, and on 17 September, Soviet forces invaded eastern Poland.[264]', 'The fall of Poland was followed by what contemporary journalists dubbed the ""Phoney War"" or Sitzkrieg (""sitting war""). Hitler instructed the two newly appointed Gauleiters of north-western Poland, Albert Forster of Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia and Arthur Greiser of Reichsgau Wartheland, to Germanise their areas, with ""no questions asked"" about how this was accomplished.[265] In Forster\'s area, ethnic Poles merely had to sign forms stating that they had German blood.[266] In contrast, Greiser agreed with Himmler and carried out an ethnic cleansing campaign towards Poles. Greiser soon complained that Forster was allowing thousands of Poles to be accepted as ""racial"" Germans and thus endangered German ""racial purity"".[265] Hitler refrained from getting involved. This inaction has been advanced as an example of the theory of ""working towards the Führer"", in which Hitler issued vague instructions and expected his subordinates to work out policies on their own.[265][267]', 'Another dispute pitched one side represented by Heinrich Himmler and Greiser, who championed ethnic cleansing in Poland, against another represented by Göring and Hans Frank (governor-general of occupied Poland), who called for turning Poland into the ""granary"" of the Reich. On 12 February 1940, the dispute was initially settled in favour of the Göring–Frank view, which ended the economically disruptive mass expulsions. On 15 May 1940, Himmler issued a memo entitled ""Some Thoughts on the Treatment of Alien Population in the East"", calling for the expulsion of the entire Jewish population of Europe into Africa and the reduction of the Polish population to a ""leaderless class of labourers"". Hitler called Himmler\'s memo ""good and correct"", and, ignoring Göring and Frank, implemented the Himmler–Greiser policy in Poland.[268]', 'On 9 April, German forces invaded Denmark and Norway. On the same day Hitler proclaimed the birth of the Greater Germanic Reich, his vision of a united empire of Germanic nations of Europe in which the Dutch, Flemish, and Scandinavians were joined into a ""racially pure"" polity under German leadership.[269] In May 1940, Germany attacked France, and conquered Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Belgium. These victories prompted Mussolini to have Italy join forces with Hitler on 10 June. France and Germany signed an armistice on 22 June.[270] Kershaw notes that Hitler\'s popularity within Germany—and German support for the war—reached its peak when he returned to Berlin on 6 July from his tour of Paris.[271] Following the unexpected swift victory, Hitler promoted twelve generals to the rank of field marshal during the 1940 Field Marshal Ceremony.[272][273]', 'Britain, whose troops were forced to evacuate France by sea from Dunkirk,[274] continued to fight alongside other British dominions in the Battle of the Atlantic. Hitler made peace overtures to the new British leader, Winston Churchill, and upon their rejection he ordered a series of aerial attacks on Royal Air Force airbases and radar stations in southeast England. On 7 September the systematic nightly bombing of London began. The German Luftwaffe failed to defeat the Royal Air Force in what became known as the Battle of Britain.[275] By the end of September, Hitler realised that air superiority for the invasion of Britain (in Operation Sea Lion) could not be achieved, and ordered the operation postponed. The nightly air raids on British cities intensified and continued for months, including London, Plymouth, and Coventry.[276]', ""On 27 September 1940, the Tripartite Pact was signed in Berlin by Saburō Kurusu of Imperial Japan, Hitler, and Italian foreign minister Ciano,[277] and later expanded to include Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria, thus yielding the Axis powers. Hitler's attempt to integrate the Soviet Union into the anti-British bloc failed after inconclusive talks between Hitler and Molotov in Berlin in November, and he ordered preparations for the invasion of the Soviet Union.[278]"", 'In early 1941, German forces were deployed to North Africa, the Balkans, and the Middle East. In February, German forces arrived in Libya to bolster the Italian presence. In April, Hitler launched the invasion of Yugoslavia, quickly followed by the invasion of Greece.[279] In May, German forces were sent to support Iraqi forces fighting against the British and to invade Crete.[280]', 'On 22 June 1941, contravening the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of 1939, over three million Axis troops attacked the Soviet Union.[281] This offensive (codenamed Operation Barbarossa) was intended to destroy the Soviet Union and seize its natural resources for subsequent aggression against the Western powers.[282][283] The action was also part of the overall plan to obtain more living space for German people; and Hitler thought a successful invasion would force Britain to negotiate a surrender.[284] The invasion conquered a huge area, including the Baltic republics, Belarus, and West Ukraine. By early August, Axis troops had advanced 500\xa0km (310 miles) and won the Battle of Smolensk. Hitler ordered Army Group Centre to temporarily halt its advance to Moscow and divert its Panzer groups to aid in the encirclement of Leningrad and Kiev.[285] His generals disagreed with this change, having advanced within 400\xa0km (250 miles) of Moscow, and his decision caused a crisis among the military leadership.[286][287] The pause provided the Red Army with an opportunity to mobilise fresh reserves; historian Russel Stolfi considers it to be one of the major factors that caused the failure of the Moscow offensive, which was resumed in October 1941 and ended disastrously in December.[285] During this crisis, Hitler appointed himself as head of the Oberkommando des Heeres.[288]', 'On 7 December 1941, Japan attacked the American fleet based at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Four days later, Hitler declared war against the United States.[289] On 18 December 1941, Himmler asked Hitler, ""What to do with the Jews of Russia?"", to which Hitler replied, ""als Partisanen auszurotten"" (""exterminate them as partisans"").[290] Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer has commented that the remark is probably as close as historians will ever get to a definitive order from Hitler for the genocide carried out during the Holocaust.[290]', ""In late 1942, German forces were defeated in the Second Battle of El Alamein,[291] thwarting Hitler's plans to seize the Suez Canal and the Middle East. Overconfident in his own military expertise following the earlier victories in 1940, Hitler became distrustful of his Army High Command and began to interfere in military and tactical planning, with damaging consequences.[292] In December 1942 and January 1943, Hitler's repeated refusal to allow their withdrawal at the Battle of Stalingrad led to the almost total destruction of the 6th Army. Over 200,000 Axis soldiers were killed and 235,000 were taken prisoner.[293] Thereafter came a decisive strategic defeat at the Battle of Kursk.[294] Hitler's military judgement became increasingly erratic, and Germany's military and economic position deteriorated, as did Hitler's health.[295]"", ""Following the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943, Mussolini was removed from power by King Victor Emmanuel III after a vote of no confidence of the Grand Council of Fascism. Marshal Pietro Badoglio, placed in charge of the government, soon surrendered to the Allies.[296] Throughout 1943 and 1944, the Soviet Union steadily forced Hitler's armies into retreat along the Eastern Front. On 6 June 1944, the Western Allied armies landed in northern France in one of the largest amphibious operations in history, Operation Overlord.[297] Many German officers concluded that defeat was inevitable and that continuing under Hitler's leadership would result in the complete destruction of the country.[298]"", ""Between 1939 and 1945, there were numerous plans to assassinate Hitler, some of which proceeded to significant degrees.[299] The most well-known and significant, the 20 July plot of 1944, came from within Germany and was at least partly driven by the increasing prospect of a German defeat in the war.[300] Part of Operation Valkyrie, the plot involved Claus von Stauffenberg planting a bomb in one of Hitler's headquarters, the Wolf's Lair at Rastenburg. Hitler narrowly survived because staff officer Heinz Brandt moved the briefcase containing the bomb behind a leg of the heavy conference table, which deflected much of the blast. Later, Hitler ordered savage reprisals resulting in the execution of more than 4,900\xa0people.[301] Hitler was put on the United Nations War Crimes Commission's first list of war criminals in December 1944, after determining that Hitler could be held criminally responsible for the acts of the Nazis in occupied countries. By March 1945, at least seven indictments had been filed against him.[302]"", 'By late 1944, both the Red Army and the Western Allies were advancing into Germany. Recognising the strength and determination of the Red Army, Hitler decided to use his remaining mobile reserves against the American and British armies, which he perceived as far weaker.[303] On 16 December, he launched the Ardennes Offensive to incite disunity among the Western Allies and perhaps convince them to join his fight against the Soviets.[304] After some temporary successes, the offensive failed.[305] With much of Germany in ruins in January 1945, Hitler spoke on the radio: ""However grave as the crisis may be at this moment, it will, despite everything, be mastered by our unalterable will.""[306] Acting on his view that Germany\'s military failures meant it had forfeited its right to survive as a nation, Hitler ordered the destruction of all German industrial infrastructure before it could fall into Allied hands.[307] Minister for Armaments Albert Speer was entrusted with executing this scorched earth policy, but he secretly disobeyed the order.[307][308] Hitler\'s hope to negotiate peace with the United States and Britain was encouraged by the death of US President Franklin D. Roosevelt on 12 April 1945, but contrary to his expectations, this caused no rift among the Allies.[304][309]', ""On 20 April, his 56th and final birthday, Hitler made his last trip from the Führerbunker to the surface. In the ruined garden of the Reich Chancellery, he awarded Iron Crosses to boy soldiers of the Hitler Youth, who were now fighting the Red Army at the front near Berlin.[310] By 21 April, Georgy Zhukov's 1st Belorussian Front had broken through the defences of General Gotthard Heinrici's Army Group Vistula during the Battle of the Seelow Heights and advanced to the outskirts of Berlin.[311] In denial about the dire situation, Hitler placed his hopes on the undermanned and under-equipped Armeeabteilung Steiner (Army Detachment Steiner), commanded by Felix Steiner. Hitler ordered Steiner to attack the northern flank of the salient, while the German Ninth Army was ordered to attack northward in a pincer attack.[312]"", 'During a military conference on 22 April, Hitler inquired about Steiner\'s offensive. He was informed that the attack had not been launched and that the Soviets had entered Berlin. Hitler ordered everyone but Wilhelm Keitel, Alfred Jodl, Hans Krebs, and Wilhelm Burgdorf to leave the room,[313] then launched into a tirade against the perceived treachery and incompetence of his generals, culminating in his declaration—for the first time—that ""everything is lost"".[314] He announced that he would stay in Berlin until the end and then shoot himself.[315]', ""By 23 April, the Red Army had surrounded Berlin,[316] and Goebbels made a proclamation urging its citizens to defend the city.[313] That same day, Göring sent a telegram from Berchtesgaden, arguing that as Hitler was isolated in Berlin, Göring should assume leadership of Germany. Göring set a deadline, after which he would consider Hitler incapacitated.[317] Hitler responded by having Göring arrested, and in his last will and testament of 29 April, he removed Göring from all government positions.[318][319] On 28 April, Hitler discovered that Himmler, who had left Berlin on 20 April, was attempting to negotiate a surrender to the Western Allies.[320][321] He considered this treason and ordered Himmler's arrest. He also ordered the execution of Hermann Fegelein, Himmler's SS representative at Hitler's headquarters in Berlin, for desertion.[322]"", ""After midnight on the night of 28–29 April, Hitler married Eva Braun in a small civil ceremony in the Führerbunker.[323][g] Later that afternoon, Hitler was informed that Mussolini had been executed by the Italian resistance movement on the previous day; this is believed to have increased his determination to avoid capture.[324] On 30 April, Soviet troops were within five hundred metres of the Reich Chancellery when Hitler shot himself in the head and Braun bit into a cyanide capsule.[325][326] In accordance with Hitler's wishes, their corpses were carried outside to the garden behind the Reich Chancellery, where they were placed in a bomb crater, doused with petrol, and set on fire as the Red Army shelling continued.[327][328][329] Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz and Goebbels assumed Hitler's roles as head of state and chancellor respectively.[330] On the evening of 1 May, Goebbels and his wife, Magda, committed suicide in the Reich Chancellery garden, after having poisoned their six children with cyanide.[331]"", ""Berlin surrendered on 2 May. The remains of the Goebbels family, General Hans Krebs (who had committed suicide that day), and Hitler's dog Blondi were repeatedly buried and exhumed by the Soviets.[332] Hitler's and Braun's remains were alleged to have been moved as well, but this is most likely Soviet disinformation. There is no evidence that any identifiable remains of Hitler or Braun—with the exception of dental bridges—were ever found by them.[333][334][335] While news of Hitler's death spread quickly, a death certificate was not issued until 1956, after a lengthy investigation to collect testimony from 42 witnesses. Hitler's death was entered as an assumption of death based on this testimony.[336]"", 'If the international Jewish financiers in and outside Europe should succeed in plunging the nations once more into a world war, then the result will not be the Bolshevisation of the earth, and thus the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe![337]', 'The Holocaust and Germany\'s war in the East were based on Hitler\'s long-standing view that the Jews were the enemy of the German people, and that Lebensraum was needed for Germany\'s expansion. He focused on Eastern Europe for this expansion, aiming to defeat Poland and the Soviet Union and then removing or killing the Jews and Slavs.[338] The Generalplan Ost (General Plan East) called for deporting the population of occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to West Siberia, for use as slave labour or to be murdered;[339] the conquered territories were to be colonised by German or ""Germanised"" settlers.[340] The goal was to implement this plan after the conquest of the Soviet Union, but when this failed, Hitler moved the plans forward.[339][341] By January 1942, he had decided that the Jews, Slavs, and other deportees considered undesirable should be killed.[342][h]', 'The genocide was organised and executed by Heinrich Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich. The records of the Wannsee Conference, held on 20 January 1942 and led by Heydrich, with fifteen senior Nazi officials participating, provide the clearest evidence of systematic planning for the Holocaust. On 22 February, Hitler was recorded saying, ""we shall regain our health only by eliminating the Jews"".[343] Similarly, at a meeting in July 1941 with leading functionaries of the Eastern territories, Hitler said that the easiest way to quickly pacify the areas would be best achieved by ""shooting everyone who even looks odd"".[344] Although no direct order from Hitler authorising the mass killings has surfaced,[345] his public speeches, orders to his generals, and the diaries of Nazi officials demonstrate that he conceived and authorised the extermination of European Jewry.[346][347] During the war, Hitler repeatedly stated his prophecy of 1939 was being fulfilled, namely, that a world war would bring about the annihilation of the Jewish race.[348] Hitler approved the Einsatzgruppen—killing squads that followed the German army through Poland, the Baltic, and the Soviet Union[349]—and was well informed about their activities.[346][350] By summer 1942, Auschwitz concentration camp was expanded to accommodate large numbers of deportees for murder or enslavement.[351] Scores of other concentration camps and satellite camps were set up throughout Europe, with several camps devoted exclusively to extermination.[352]', 'Between 1939 and 1945, the Schutzstaffel (SS), assisted by collaborationist governments and recruits from occupied countries, were responsible for the deaths of at least eleven million non-combatants,[353][339] including the murders of about 6\xa0million Jews (representing two-thirds of the Jewish population of Europe),[354][i] and between 200,000 and 1,500,000 Romani people.[356][354] The victims were killed in concentration and extermination camps and in ghettos, and through mass shootings.[357][358] Many victims of the Holocaust were murdered in gas chambers or shot, while others died of starvation or disease or while working as slave labourers.[357][358] In addition to eliminating Jews, the Nazis planned to reduce the population of the conquered territories by 30\xa0million people through starvation in an action called the Hunger Plan. Food supplies would be diverted to the German army and German civilians. Cities would be razed, and the land allowed to return to forest or resettled by German colonists.[359] Together, the Hunger Plan and Generalplan Ost would have led to the starvation of 80\xa0million people in the Soviet Union.[360] These partially fulfilled plans resulted in additional deaths, bringing the total number of civilians and prisoners of war who died in the democide to an estimated 19.3\xa0million people.[361]', 'Hitler\'s policies resulted in the killing of nearly two million non-Jewish Polish civilians,[362] over three million Soviet prisoners of war,[363] communists and other political opponents, homosexuals, the physically and mentally disabled,[364][365] Jehovah\'s Witnesses, Adventists, and trade unionists. Hitler never spoke publicly about the killings and seems to have never visited the concentration camps.[366] The Nazis embraced the concept of racial hygiene. On 15 September 1935, Hitler presented two laws—known as the Nuremberg Laws—to the Reichstag. The laws banned sexual relations and marriages between Aryans and Jews and were later extended to include ""Gypsies, Negroes or their bastard offspring"".[367] The laws stripped all non-Aryans of their German citizenship and forbade the employment of non-Jewish women under the age of 45 in Jewish households.[368] Hitler\'s early eugenic policies targeted children with physical and developmental disabilities in a programme dubbed Action Brandt, and he later authorised a euthanasia programme for adults with serious mental and physical disabilities, now referred to as Aktion T4.[369]', 'Hitler ruled the Nazi Party autocratically by asserting the Führerprinzip (leader principle). The principle relied on absolute obedience of all subordinates to their superiors; thus, he viewed the government structure as a pyramid, with himself—the infallible leader—at the apex. Rank in the party was not determined by elections—positions were filled through appointment by those of higher rank, who demanded unquestioning obedience to the will of the leader.[370] Hitler\'s leadership style was to give contradictory orders to his subordinates and to place them into positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped with those of others, to have ""the stronger one [do] the job"".[371] In this way, Hitler fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power. His cabinet never met after 1938, and he discouraged his ministers from meeting independently.[372][373] Hitler typically did not give written orders; instead, he communicated verbally, or had them conveyed through his close associate Martin Bormann.[374] He entrusted Bormann with his paperwork, appointments, and personal finances; Bormann used his position to control the flow of information and access to Hitler.[375]', ""Hitler dominated his country's war effort during World War II to a greater extent than any other national leader. He strengthened his control of the armed forces in 1938, and subsequently made all major decisions regarding Germany's military strategy. His decision to mount a risky series of offensives against Norway, France, and the Low Countries in 1940 against the advice of the military proved successful, though the diplomatic and military strategies he employed in attempts to force the United Kingdom out of the war ended in failure.[376] Hitler deepened his involvement in the war effort by appointing himself commander-in-chief of the Army in December 1941; from this point forward, he personally directed the war against the Soviet Union, while his military commanders facing the Western Allies retained a degree of autonomy.[377] Hitler's leadership became increasingly disconnected from reality as the war turned against Germany, with the military's defensive strategies often hindered by his slow decision-making and frequent directives to hold untenable positions. Nevertheless, he continued to believe that only his leadership could deliver victory.[376] In the final months of the war, Hitler refused to consider peace negotiations, regarding the destruction of Germany as preferable to surrender.[378] The military did not challenge Hitler's dominance of the war effort, and senior officers generally supported and enacted his decisions.[379]"", ""Hitler created a public image as a celibate man without a domestic life, dedicated entirely to his political mission and the nation.[147][380] He met his lover, Eva Braun, in 1929,[381] and married her on 29 April 1945, one day before they both committed suicide.[382] In September 1931, his half-niece, Geli Raubal, took her own life with Hitler's gun in his Munich apartment. It was rumoured among contemporaries that Geli was in a romantic relationship with him, and her death was a source of deep, lasting pain.[383] Paula Hitler, the younger sister of Hitler and the last living member of his immediate family, died in June 1960.[15]"", 'Hitler was born to a practising Catholic mother and an anti-clerical father; after leaving home, Hitler never again attended Mass or received the sacraments.[384][385][386] Albert Speer states that Hitler railed against the church to his political associates, and though he never officially left the church, he had no attachment to it.[387] He adds that Hitler felt that in the absence of organised religion, people would turn to mysticism, which he considered regressive.[387] According to Speer, Hitler believed that Japanese religious beliefs or Islam would have been a more suitable religion for Germans than Christianity, with its ""meekness and flabbiness"".[388] Historian John S. Conway states that Hitler was fundamentally opposed to the Christian churches.[389] According to Bullock, Hitler did not believe in God, was anticlerical, and held Christian ethics in contempt because they contravened his preferred view of ""survival of the fittest"".[390] He favoured aspects of Protestantism that suited his own views, and adopted some elements of the Catholic Church\'s hierarchical organisation, liturgy, and phraseology.[391] In a 1932 speech, Hitler stated that he was not a Catholic, and declared himself a German Christian.[392] In a conversation with Albert Speer, Hitler said, ""Through me the Evangelical Church could become the established church, as in England.""[393]', 'Hitler viewed the church as an important politically conservative influence on society,[394] and he adopted a strategic relationship with it that ""suited his immediate political purposes"".[389] In public, Hitler often praised Christian heritage and German Christian culture, though professing a belief in an ""Aryan Jesus"" who fought against the Jews.[395] Any pro-Christian public rhetoric contradicted his private statements, which described Christianity as ""absurdity""[396] and nonsense founded on lies.[397]', 'According to a US Office of Strategic Services (OSS) report, ""The Nazi Master Plan"", Hitler planned to destroy the influence of Christian churches within the Reich.[398][399] His eventual goal was the total elimination of Christianity.[400] This goal informed Hitler\'s movement early on, but he saw it as inexpedient to publicly express this extreme position.[401] According to Bullock, Hitler wanted to wait until after the war before executing this plan.[402] Speer wrote that Hitler had a negative view of Himmler\'s and Alfred Rosenberg\'s mystical notions and Himmler\'s attempt to mythologise the SS. Hitler was more pragmatic, and his ambitions centred on more practical concerns.[403][404]', 'Researchers have variously suggested that Hitler suffered from irritable bowel syndrome, skin lesions, irregular heartbeat, coronary sclerosis,[405] Parkinson\'s disease,[295][406] syphilis,[406] giant-cell arteritis,[407] tinnitus,[408] and monorchism.[409] In a report prepared for the OSS in 1943, Walter Charles Langer of Harvard University described Hitler as a ""neurotic psychopath"".[410] In his 1977 book The Psychopathic God: Adolf Hitler, historian Robert G. L. Waite proposes that Hitler suffered from borderline personality disorder.[411] Historians Henrik Eberle and Hans-Joachim Neumann consider that while he suffered from a number of illnesses including Parkinson\'s disease, Hitler did not experience pathological delusions and was always fully aware of, and therefore responsible for, his decisions.[412][314]', 'Sometime in the 1930s, Hitler adopted a mainly vegetarian diet,[413][414] avoiding all meat and fish from 1942 onwards. At social events, he sometimes gave graphic accounts of the slaughter of animals in an effort to make his guests shun meat.[415] Bormann had a greenhouse constructed near the Berghof (near Berchtesgaden) to ensure a steady supply of fresh fruit and vegetables for Hitler.[416] Hitler stopped drinking alcohol around the time he became vegetarian and thereafter only very occasionally drank beer or wine on social occasions.[417][418] He was a non-smoker for most of his adult life, but smoked heavily in his youth (25 to 40 cigarettes a day); he eventually quit, calling the habit ""a waste of money"".[419] He encouraged his close associates to quit by offering a gold watch to anyone able to break the habit.[420] Hitler began using amphetamine occasionally after 1937 and became addicted to it in late 1942.[421] Speer linked this use of amphetamine to Hitler\'s increasingly erratic behaviour and inflexible decision-making (for example, rarely allowing military retreats).[422]', ""Prescribed 90 medications during the war years by his personal physician, Theodor Morell, Hitler took many pills each day for chronic stomach problems and other ailments.[423] He regularly consumed amphetamine, barbiturates, opiates, and cocaine,[424][425] as well as potassium bromide and atropa belladonna (the latter in the form of Doktor Koster's Antigaspills).[426] He suffered ruptured eardrums as a result of the 20 July plot bomb blast in 1944, and 200 wood splinters had to be removed from his legs.[427] Newsreel footage of Hitler shows tremors in his left hand and a shuffling walk, which began before the war and worsened towards the end of his life.[423] Ernst-Günther Schenck and several other doctors who met Hitler in the last weeks of his life also formed a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.[428]"", 'For peace, freedomand democracynever again fascismmillions of dead warn [us]', 'According to historian Joachim Fest, Hitler\'s suicide was likened by numerous contemporaries to a ""spell"" being broken.[430] Similarly, Speer commented in Inside the Third Reich on his emotions the day after Hitler\'s suicide: ""Only now was the spell broken, the magic extinguished.""[431] Public support for Hitler had collapsed by the time of his death, which few Germans mourned; Kershaw argues that most civilians and military personnel were too busy adjusting to the collapse of the country or fleeing from the fighting to take any interest.[432] According to historian John Toland, Nazism ""burst like a bubble"" without its leader.[433]', 'Kershaw describes Hitler as ""the embodiment of modern political evil"".[3] ""Never in history has such ruination—physical and moral—been associated with the name of one man"", he adds.[434] Hitler\'s political programme brought about a world war, leaving behind a devastated and impoverished Eastern and Central Europe. Germany suffered wholesale destruction, characterised as Stunde Null (Zero Hour).[435] Hitler\'s policies inflicted human suffering on an unprecedented scale;[436] according to R.\xa0J. Rummel, the Nazi regime was responsible for the democidal killing of an estimated 19.3\xa0million civilians and prisoners of war.[353] In addition, 28.7\xa0million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in the European theatre of World War II.[353] The number of civilians killed during the Second World War was unprecedented in the history of warfare.[437] Historians, philosophers, and politicians often use the word ""evil"" to describe the Nazi regime.[438] Many European countries have criminalised both the promotion of Nazism and Holocaust denial.[439]', 'Historian Friedrich Meinecke described Hitler as ""one of the great examples of the singular and incalculable power of personality in historical life"".[440] English historian Hugh Trevor-Roper saw him as ""among the \'terrible simplifiers\' of history, the most systematic, the most historical, the most philosophical, and yet the coarsest, cruelest, least magnanimous conqueror the world has ever known"".[441] For the historian John M. Roberts, Hitler\'s defeat marked the end of a phase of European history dominated by Germany.[442] In its place emerged the Cold War, a global confrontation between the Western Bloc, dominated by the United States and other NATO nations, and the Eastern Bloc, dominated by the Soviet Union.[443] Historian Sebastian Haffner asserted that without Hitler and the displacement of the Jews, the modern nation state of Israel would not exist. He contends that without Hitler, the de-colonisation of former European spheres of influence would have been postponed.[444] Further, Haffner claimed that other than Alexander the Great, Hitler had a more significant impact than any other comparable historical figure, in that he too caused a wide range of worldwide changes in a relatively short time span.[445]', ""Hitler exploited documentary films and newsreels to inspire a cult of personality. He was involved and appeared in a series of propaganda films throughout his political career, many made by Leni Riefenstahl, regarded as a pioneer of modern filmmaking.[446] Hitler's propaganda film appearances include:"", 'Final solution']","Adolf Hitler[a] (20 April 1889 – 30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the dictator of Nazi Germany from 1933 until his suicide in 1945. He rose to power as the leader of the Nazi Party,[c] becoming the chancellor in 1933 and then taking the title of Führer und Reichskanzler in 1934.[d] His invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 marked the start of the Second World War. He was closely involved in military operations throughout the war and was central to the perpetration of the Holocaust: the genocide of about six million Jews and millions of other victims.","The text discusses Adolf Hitler's life, death, and legacy.

Hirohito,"[""Hirohito[a] (29 April 1901\xa0– 7 January 1989), posthumously honored as Emperor Shōwa,[b] was the 124th emperor of Japan according to the traditional order of succession, reigning from 1926 until his death in 1989. He was the longest-reigning Japanese emperor and one of the world's longest-reigning monarchs. As emperor during the Shōwa era, Hirohito oversaw the rise of Japanese militarism, Japan's expansionism in Asia, the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II, and the postwar Japanese economic miracle. "", ""Hirohito was the first child of Crown Prince Yoshihito and Crown Princess Sadako, later Emperor Taishō and Empress Teimei. After his father's accession to the throne in 1912, Hirohito was proclaimed crown prince and heir apparent in 1916. In 1921, he made an official visit to Great Britain and Western Europe in the first overseas visit by a member of the Japanese royal family. Owing to his father's ill health, Hirohito became his regent that year. In 1924, he married Princess Nagako Kuni, with whom he had seven children."", ""Upon his father’s death in 1926, Hirohito became emperor, serving as head of state during the 1930s as the military increasingly dominated Japanese politics. When Japan's Kwantung Army staged the Mukden incident as a pretext for its invasion of Manchuria in 1931, Hirohito made no objection. Following the onset of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, tensions steadily grew between Japan and the United States. Once Hirohito formally sanctioned his government's decision to go to war against the U.S. and its allies on 1 December 1941, the Pacific War began one week later with a Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor as well as on other U.S. and British colonies in the region. After atomic bombs were dropped on Japan and the Soviet Union invaded Japanese-occupied Manchuria, Hirohito called upon his country's forces to surrender in a radio broadcast on 15 August 1945. The extent of his involvement in military decision-making and wartime culpability remain subjects of historical debate."", 'Following the surrender of Japan, Emperor Hirohito was not prosecuted for war crimes at the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal even though the Japanese had waged war in his name. The head of the Allied occupation of the country, Douglas MacArthur, believed that a cooperative emperor would facilitate a peaceful occupation and other U.S. postwar objectives. MacArthur therefore excluded any evidence from the tribunal which could have incriminated Hirohito or other members of the royal family.[1] In 1946, Hirohito was pressured by the Allies into renouncing his divinity. Under Japan\'s new constitution drafted by U.S. officials, his role as emperor was redefined in 1947 as ""the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people"". He died in 1989, and was succeeded as emperor by his eldest son, Akihito.  ', 'Hirohito was born on 29 April 1901 at Tōgū Palace in Aoyama, Tokyo during the reign of his grandfather, Emperor Meiji,[2] the first son of 21-year-old Crown Prince Yoshihito (the future Emperor Taishō) and 16-year-old Crown Princess Sadako, the future Empress Teimei.[3] He was the grandson of Emperor Meiji and Yanagiwara Naruko. His childhood title was Prince Michi.', 'Ten weeks after he was born, Hirohito was removed from the court and placed in the care of Count Kawamura Sumiyoshi, who raised him as his grandchild. At the age of 3, Hirohito and his brother Yasuhito were returned to court when Kawamura died\xa0– first to the imperial mansion in Numazu, Shizuoka, then back to the Aoyama Palace.[4]', ""In 1908, he began elementary studies at the Gakushūin (Peers School).[5] Emperor Mutsuhito, then appointed General Nogi Maresuke to be the Gakushūin's tenth president as well as the one in-charge on educating his grandson. The main aspect that they focused was on physical education and health, primarily because Hirohito was a sickly child, on par with the impartment or inculcation of values such as frugality, patience, manliness, self-control, and devotion to the duty at hand.[6]"", 'During 1912, at the age of 11, Hirohito was commissioned into the Imperial Japanese Army as a Second Lieutenant and in the Imperial Japanese Navy as an Ensign. He was also bestowed with the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Chrysanthemum.[7] When his grandfather, Emperor Meiji died on 30 July 1912, Yoshihito assumed the throne and his eldest son, Hirohito became heir apparent.', 'After learning about the death of his instructor, General Nogi, he along with his brothers were reportedly overcome with emotions. He would later acknowledge the lasting influence of Nogi in his life. At that time he was still two years away from completing primary school, henceforth his education was compensated by Fleet Admiral Togo Heihachiro and Naval Captain Ogasawara Naganari, wherein later on, would become his major opponents with regards to his national defense policy.[8]', 'Shiratori Kurakichi, one of his middle-school instructors, was one of the personalities who deeply influenced the life of Hirohito. Kurakichi was a trained historian from Germany, imbibing the positivist historiographic trend by Leopold von Ranke. He was the one who inculcated in the mind of the young Hirohito that there is a connection between the divine origin of the imperial line and the aspiration of linking it to the myth of the racial superiority and homogeneity of the Japanese. The emperors were often a driving force in the modernization of their country. He taught Hirohito that the Empire of Japan was created and governed through diplomatic actions (taking into accounts the interests of other nations benevolently and justly).[9]', 'On 2 November 1916, Hirohito was formally proclaimed crown prince and heir apparent. An investiture ceremony was not required to confirm this status.[10]', 'From 3 March to 3 September 1921 (Taisho 10), the Crown Prince made official visits to the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Vatican City and Malta (then a protectorate of the British Empire). This was the first visit to Western Europe by the Crown Prince.[c] Despite strong opposition in Japan, this was realized by the efforts of elder Japanese statesmen (Genrō) such as Yamagata Aritomo and Saionji Kinmochi.', 'The departure of Prince Hirohito was widely reported in newspapers. The Japanese battleship Katori was used, and departed from Yokohama, sailed to Naha, Hong Kong, Singapore, Colombo, Suez, Cairo, and Gibraltar. In April, Hirohito was present in Malta for the opening of the Maltese Parliament.[11] After sailing for two months, the Katori arrived in Portsmouth on 9 May, on the same day reaching the British capital, London. Hirohito was welcomed in the UK as a partner of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance and met with King George V and Prime Minister David Lloyd George.', ""That evening, a banquet was held at Buckingham Palace, where Hirohito met with George V and Prince Arthur of Connaught. George V said that he treated his father like Hirohito,[clarification needed] who was nervous in an unfamiliar foreign country, and that relieved his tension. The next day, he met Prince Edward (the future Edward VIII) at Windsor Castle, and a banquet was held every day thereafter. In London, he toured the British Museum, the Tower of London, the Bank of England, Lloyd's Marine Insurance, Oxford University, Army University, and the Naval War College. He also enjoyed theater at the New Oxford Theatre and the Delhi Theatre.[12]"", 'At the University of Cambridge, he listened to Professor J. R. Tanner\'s lecture on ""Relationship between the British Royal Family and its People"", and was awarded an honorary doctorate degree.[13][14] He visited Edinburgh, Scotland, from 19 to 20 May, and was also awarded an Honorary Doctor of Laws at the University of Edinburgh. He stayed at the residence of John Stewart-Murray, 8th Duke of Atholl, for three days. On his stay with Stuart-Murray, the prince was quoted as saying, ""The rise of Bolsheviks won\'t happen if you live a simple life like Duke Athol.""[13]', 'In Italy, he met with King Vittorio Emanuele III and others, attended official international banquets, and visited places such as the fierce battlefields of World War I.', 'After returning (from Europe) to Japan, Hirohito became Regent of Japan (Sesshō) on 25 November 1921, in place of his ailing father, who was affected by mental illness.[15][16]  In 1923 he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in the army and Commander in the navy, and army Colonel and Navy Captain in 1925.', 'Over 12 days in April 1923, Hirohito visited Taiwan, which had been a Japanese colony since 1895.[17] This was a voyage his father, the then Crown Prince Yoshihito had planned in 1911 but never completed.[18]', ""It was widely reported in Taiwanese newspapers that famous high-end restaurants served typical Chinese luxury dishes for the Prince, such as swallow's nest and shark fin, as Taiwanese cuisine. This was the first time an Emperor or a Crown Prince has ever eaten local cuisine on a colony, or had foreign dishes other than Western cuisine abroad, thus exceptional preparations were required: The eight chefs and other cooking staff were purified for a week (through fasting and ritual bathing) before the cooking of the feast could begin. This tasting of “Taiwanese cuisine” of the Prince Regent should be understood as part of an integration ceremony of incorporating the colony into the empire, which can be seen as the context and purpose of Hirohito's Taiwanese visit.[19]"", ""Having visited several sites outside of Taipei, Hirohito returned to the capital on the 24th and on 25 April, just one day before his departure, he visited the Beitou hotspring district of Taipei and its oldest facility. The original structure had been built in 1913 in the style of a traditional Japanese bathhouse. However, in anticipation of Hirohito's visit an additional residential wing was added to the earlier building, this time in the style of an Edwardian country house. The new building was subsequently opened to the public and was deemed the largest public bathhouse in the Japanese Empire.[20][18]Crown Prince Hirohito was a student of science, and he had heard that Beitou Creek was one of only two hot springs in the world that contained a rare radioactive mineral. So, he decided to walk into the creek to investigate."", ""Naturally, concerned for a royal family member's safety, his entourage scurried around, seeking flat rocks to use as stepping stones. After that, these stones were carefully mounted and given the official name: “His Imperial Highness Crown Prince of Japan's Stepping Stones for River Crossing,” with a stele alongside to tell the story.[22]"", 'Crown Prince Hirohito handed his Imperial Notice to Governor-General Den Kenjiro and departed from Keelung on 26 April 1923.[23]', 'The Great Kantō earthquake devastated Tokyo on 1 September 1923, killing some 100,000 people and leveling vast areas. The city could be rebuilt drawing on the then massive timber reserves of Taiwan. In the aftermath of the tragical disaster, the military authorities saw an opportunity to annihilate the communist movement in Japan. During the Kantō Massacre an estimated 6000 people, mainly ethnic Koreans, were annihilated. The backlash culminated in an assassination attempt by Daisuke Namba on the Prince Regent on 27 December 1923 in the so-called Toranomon incident, but the attempt failed.[24][18] During interrogation, the failed assassin claimed to be a communist and was executed.[25]', 'Prince Hirohito married his distant cousin Princess Nagako Kuni, the eldest daughter of Prince Kuniyoshi Kuni, on 26 January 1924. They had two sons and five daughters[26] (see Issue).', 'The daughters who lived to adulthood left the imperial family as a result of the American reforms of the Japanese imperial household in October 1947 (in the case of Princess Shigeko) or under the terms of the Imperial Household Law at the moment of their subsequent marriages (in the cases of Princesses Kazuko, Atsuko, and Takako).', 'On 25 December 1926, Yoshihito died and Hirohito became emperor. The Crown Prince was said to have received the succession (senso).[27] The Taishō era\'s end and the Shōwa era\'s beginning (Enlightened Peace) were proclaimed. The deceased Emperor was posthumously renamed Emperor Taishō within days. Following Japanese custom, the new Emperor was never referred to by his given name but rather was referred to simply as ""His Majesty the Emperor"" which may be shortened to ""His Majesty."" In writing, the Emperor was also referred to formally as ""The Reigning Emperor.""', 'In November 1928, Hirohito\'s accession was confirmed in ceremonies (sokui)[27] which are conventionally identified as ""enthronement"" and ""coronation"" (Shōwa no tairei-shiki); but this formal event would have been more accurately described as a public confirmation that he possessed the Japanese Imperial Regalia,[28] also called the Three Sacred Treasures, which have been handed down through the centuries.[29] However, his enthronement events were planned and staged under the economic conditions of a recession whereas the 55th Imperial Diet unanimously passed $7,360,000 for the festivities.[30]', ""The first part of Hirohito's reign took place against a background of financial crisis and increasing military power within the government through both legal and extralegal means. The Imperial Japanese Army and Imperial Japanese Navy held veto power over the formation of cabinets since 1900. Between 1921 and 1944, there were 64 separate incidents of political violence."", 'Hirohito narrowly escaped assassination by a hand grenade thrown by a Korean independence activist, Lee Bong-chang, in Tokyo on 9 January 1932, in the Sakuradamon Incident.', ""Another notable case was the assassination of moderate Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi in 1932, marking the end of civilian control of the military. The February 26 incident, an attempted coup d'état, followed in February 1936. It was carried out by junior Army officers of the Kōdōha faction who had the sympathy of many high-ranking officers including Yasuhito, Prince Chichibu, one of Hirohito's brothers. This revolt was occasioned by a loss of political support by the militarist faction in Diet elections. The coup resulted in the murders of several high government and Army officials."", 'When Chief Aide-de-camp Shigeru Honjō informed him of the revolt, Hirohito immediately ordered that it be put down and referred to the officers as ""rebels"" (bōto). Shortly thereafter, he ordered Army Minister Yoshiyuki Kawashima to suppress the rebellion within the hour. He asked for reports from Honjō every 30 minutes. The next day, when told by Honjō that the high command had made little progress in quashing the rebels, the Emperor told him ""I Myself, will lead the Konoe Division and subdue them."" The rebellion was suppressed following his orders on 29 February.[31]', 'Beginning from the Mukden Incident in 1931 in which Japan staged a false flag operation and made a false accusation against Chinese dissidents as a pretext to invade Manchuria, Japan occupied Chinese territories and established puppet governments. Such aggression was recommended to Hirohito by his chiefs of staff and prime minister Fumimaro Konoe, and Hirohito did not voice objection to the invasion of China.[32][page\xa0needed][33][1][34]', 'A diary by chamberlain Kuraji Ogura says that he was reluctant to start war against China in 1937 because they had underestimated China\'s military strength and Japan should be cautious in its strategy. In this regard, Ogura writes Hirohito said that ""once you start (a war), it cannot easily be stopped in the middle ... What\'s important is when to end the war"" and ""one should be cautious in starting a war, but once begun, it should be carried out thoroughly.""[35]', ""Nonetheless, according to Herbert Bix, Hirohito's main concern seems to have been the possibility of an attack by the Soviet Union given his questions to his chief of staff, Prince Kan'in Kotohito, and army minister, Hajime Sugiyama, about the time it could take to crush Chinese resistance and how could they prepare for the eventuality of a Soviet incursion. Based on Bix's findings, Hirohito was displeased by Prince Kan'in's evasive responses about the substance of such contingency plans but nevertheless still approved the decision to move troops to North China.[36]"", 'According to Akira Fujiwara, Hirohito endorsed the policy of qualifying the invasion of China as an ""incident"" instead of a ""war""; therefore, he did not issue any notice to observe international law in this conflict (unlike what his predecessors did in previous conflicts officially recognized by Japan as wars), and the Deputy Minister of the Japanese Army instructed the chief of staff of Japanese China Garrison Army on 5 August not to use the term ""prisoners of war"" for Chinese captives. This instruction led to the removal of the constraints of international law on the treatment of Chinese prisoners.[37] The works of Yoshiaki Yoshimi and Seiya Matsuno show that Hirohito also authorized, by specific orders (rinsanmei), the use of chemical weapons against the Chinese.[38]', ""Later in his life, Hirohito looked back on his decision to give the go-ahead to wage a 'defensive' war against China and opined that his foremost priority was not to wage war with China but to prepare for a war with the Soviet Union, as his army had reassured him that the China war would end within three months, but that decision of his had haunted him since he forgot that the Japanese forces in China were drastically fewer than that of the Chinese, hence the shortsightedness of his perspective was evident.[39]"", 'On 1 December 1937, Hirohito had given formal instruction to General Iwane Matsui to capture and occupy the enemy capital of Nanking. He was very eager to fight this battle since he and his council firmly believed that all it would take is a one huge blow to bring forth the surrender of Chiang Kai-shek.[40] He even gave an Imperial Rescript to Iwane when he returned to Tokyo a year later, despite the brutality that his officers had inflicted on the Chinese populace in Nanking; thus Hirohito had seemingly turned a blind eye to and condoned these monstrosities.', 'During the invasion of Wuhan, from August to October 1938, Hirohito authorized the use of toxic gas on 375 separate occasions,[41] despite the resolution adopted by the League of Nations on 14 May condemning Japanese use of toxic gas.', ""In July 1939, Hirohito quarrelled with his brother, Prince Chichibu, over whether to support the Anti-Comintern Pact, and reprimanded the army minister, Seishirō Itagaki.[42] But after the success of the Wehrmacht in Europe, Hirohito consented to the alliance. On 27 September 1940, ostensibly under Hirohito's leadership, Japan became a contracting partner of the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy forming the Axis powers."", 'The objectives to be obtained were clearly defined: a free hand to continue with the conquest of China and Southeast Asia, no increase in U.S. or British military forces in the region, and cooperation by the West ""in the acquisition of goods needed by our Empire.""[43]', 'On 5 September, Prime Minister Konoe informally submitted a draft of the decision to Hirohito, just one day in advance of the Imperial Conference at which it would be formally implemented. On this evening, Hirohito had a meeting with the chief of staff of the army, Sugiyama, chief of staff of the navy, Osami Nagano, and Prime Minister Konoe. Hirohito questioned Sugiyama about the chances of success of an open war with the Occident. As Sugiyama answered positively, Hirohito scolded him:', ""—At the time of the China Incident, the army told me that we could achieve peace immediately after dealing them one blow with three divisions ... but you can't still beat Chiang Kai-shek even today! Sugiyama, you were army minister at that time.—China is a vast area with many ways in and ways out, and we met unexpectedly big difficulties ...—You say the interior of China is huge; isn't the Pacific Ocean even bigger than China? ... Didn't I caution you each time about those matters? Sugiyama, are you lying to me?[44]"", 'Chief of Naval General Staff Admiral Nagano, a former Navy Minister and vastly experienced, later told a trusted colleague, ""I have never seen the Emperor reprimand us in such a manner, his face turning red and raising his voice.""[45][46]', ""Nevertheless, all speakers at the Imperial Conference were united in favor of war rather than diplomacy.[47] Baron Yoshimichi Hara, President of the Imperial Council and Hirohito's representative, then questioned them closely, producing replies to the effect that war would be considered only as a last resort from some, and silence from others."", 'On 8 October, Sugiyama signed a 47-page report to the Emperor (sōjōan) outlining in minute detail plans for the advance into Southeast Asia. During the third week of October, Sugiyama gave Hirohito a 51-page document, ""Materials in Reply to the Throne,"" about the operational outlook for the war.[48]', 'As war preparations continued, Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe found himself increasingly isolated, and he resigned on 16 October. He justified himself to his chief cabinet secretary, Kenji Tomita, by stating:', 'Of course His Majesty is a pacifist, and there is no doubt he wished to avoid war. When I told him that to initiate war was a mistake, he agreed. But the next day, he would tell me: ""You were worried about it yesterday, but you do not have to worry so much."" Thus, gradually, he began to lean toward war. And the next time I met him, he leaned even more toward. In short, I felt the Emperor was telling me: my prime minister does not understand military matters, I know much more. In short, the Emperor had absorbed the view of the army and navy high commands.[49]', 'The army and the navy recommended the appointment of Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni, one of Hirohito\'s uncles, as prime minister. According to the Shōwa ""Monologue"", written after the war, Hirohito then said that if the war were to begin while a member of the imperial house was prime minister, the imperial house would have to carry the responsibility and he was opposed to this.[50] Instead, Hirohito chose the hard-line General Hideki Tōjō, who was known for his devotion to the imperial institution, and asked him to make a policy review of what had been sanctioned by the Imperial Conferences.', 'On 2 November Tōjō, Sugiyama, and Nagano reported to Hirohito that the review of eleven points had been in vain. Emperor Hirohito gave his consent to the war and then asked: ""Are you going to provide justification for the war?""[51][52] The decision for war against the United States was presented for approval to Hirohito by General Tōjō, Naval Minister Admiral Shigetarō Shimada, and Japanese Foreign Minister Shigenori Tōgō.[53]', 'On 3 November, Nagano explained in detail the plan of the attack on Pearl Harbor to Hirohito.[54] On 5 November Emperor Hirohito approved in imperial conference the operations plan for a war against the Western world and had many meetings with the military and Tōjō until the end of the month.[55] He initially showed hesitance towards engaging in war, but eventually approved the decision to strike Pearl Harbor despite opposition from certain advisors.[56] In the period leading up to Pearl Harbor, he expanded his control over military matters and participated in the Conference of Military Councillors, which was considered unusual of him. Additionally, he sought additional information regarding the attack plans.[56] An aide reported that he openly showed joy upon learning of the success of the surprise attacks.[56]', 'On 25 November Henry L. Stimson, United States Secretary of War, noted in his diary that he had discussed with U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt the severe likelihood that Japan was about to launch a surprise attack and that the question had been ""how we should maneuver them [the Japanese] into the position of firing the first shot without allowing too much danger to ourselves.""', 'On the following day, 26 November 1941, U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull presented the Japanese ambassador with the Hull note, which as one of its conditions demanded the complete withdrawal of all Japanese troops from French Indochina and China. Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tojo said to his cabinet, ""This is an ultimatum."" On 1 December an Imperial Conference sanctioned the ""War against the United States, United Kingdom and the Kingdom of the Netherlands.""[57]', 'On 8 December (7 December in Hawaii), 1941, in simultaneous attacks, Japanese forces struck at the Hong Kong Garrison, the United States Fleet in Pearl Harbor and in the Philippines, and began the invasion of Malaya.', 'With the nation fully committed to the war, Hirohito took a keen interest in military progress and sought to boost morale. According to Akira Yamada and Akira Fujiwara, Hirohito made major interventions in some military operations. For example, he pressed Sugiyama four times, on 13 and 21 January and 9 and 26 February, to increase troop strength and launch an attack on Bataan. On 9 February 19 March, and 29 May, Hirohito ordered the Army Chief of staff to examine the possibilities for an attack on Chongqing in China, which led to Operation Gogo.[58]', 'While some authors, like journalists Peter Jennings and Todd Brewster, say that throughout the war, Hirohito was ""outraged"" at Japanese war crimes and the political dysfunction of many societal institutions that proclaimed their loyalty to him, and sometimes spoke up against them,[59] others, such as historians Herbert P. Bix and Mark Felton, as well as the expert on China\'s international relations Michael Tai, point out that Hirohito personally sanctioned the ""Three Alls policy"" (Sankō Sakusen), a scorched earth strategy implemented in China from 1942 to 1945 and which was both directly and indirectly responsible for the deaths of ""more than 2.7 million"" Chinese civilians.[60][61][62]', ""As the tide of war began to turn against Japan (around late 1942 and early 1943), the flow of information to the palace gradually began to bear less and less relation to reality, while others suggest that Hirohito worked closely with Prime Minister Hideki Tojo, continued to be well and accurately briefed by the military, and knew Japan's military position precisely right up to the point of surrender. The chief of staff of the General Affairs section of the Prime Minister's office, Shuichi Inada, remarked to Tōjō's private secretary, Sadao Akamatsu:"", ""There has never been a cabinet in which the prime minister, and all the ministers, reported so often to the throne. In order to effect the essence of genuine direct imperial rule and to relieve the concerns of the Emperor, the ministers reported to the throne matters within the scope of their responsibilities as per the prime minister's directives\xa0... In times of intense activities, typed drafts were presented to the Emperor with corrections in red. First draft, second draft, final draft and so forth, came as deliberations progressed one after the other and were sanctioned accordingly by the Emperor.[63]"", ""In the first six months of war, all the major engagements had been victories. Japanese advances were stopped in the summer of 1942 with the Battle of Midway and the landing of the American forces on Guadalcanal and Tulagi in August. Hirohito played an increasingly influential role in the war; in eleven major episodes he was deeply involved in supervising the actual conduct of war operations. Hirohito pressured the High Command to order an early attack on the Philippines in 1941–42, including the fortified Bataan peninsula. He secured the deployment of army air power in the Guadalcanal campaign. Following Japan's withdrawal from Guadalcanal he demanded a new offensive in New Guinea, which was duly carried out but failed badly. Unhappy with the navy's conduct of the war, he criticized its withdrawal from the central Solomon Islands and demanded naval battles against the Americans for the losses they had inflicted in the Aleutians. The battles were disasters. Finally, it was at his insistence that plans were drafted for the recapture of Saipan and, later, for an offensive in the Battle of Okinawa.[64]  With the Army and Navy bitterly feuding, he settled disputes over the allocation of resources. He helped plan military offenses.[65]"", ""In September 1944, Hirohito declared that it must be his citizens' resolve to smash the evil purposes of the Westerners so that their imperial destiny might continue, but all along, it is just a mask for the urgent need of Japan to scratch a victory against the counter-offensive campaign of the Allied Forces.[66]"", 'On 18 October 1944, the Imperial headquarters had resolved that the Japanese must make a stand in the vicinity of Leyte to prevent the Americans from landing in the Philippines. This view was widely frowned upon and disgruntled the policymakers from both the army and navy sectors. Hirohito was quoted that he approved of such since if they won in that campaign, they would be finally having a room to negotiate with the Americans. As high as their spirits could go, the reality check for the Japanese would also come into play since the forces they have sent in Leyte, was practically the ones that would efficiently defend the island of Luzon, hence the Japanese had struck a huge blow in their own military planning.[67]', 'The media, under tight government control, repeatedly portrayed him as lifting the popular morale even as the Japanese cities came under heavy air attack in 1944–45 and food and housing shortages mounted.  Japanese retreats and defeats were celebrated by the media as successes that portended ""Certain Victory.""[68] Only gradually did it become apparent to the Japanese people that the situation was very grim owing to growing shortages of food, medicine, and fuel as U.S. submarines began wiping out Japanese shipping. Starting in mid 1944, American raids on the major cities of Japan made a mockery of the unending tales of victory. Later that year, with the downfall of Tojo\'s government, two other prime ministers were appointed to continue the war effort, Kuniaki Koiso and Kantarō Suzuki—each with the formal approval of Hirohito. Both were unsuccessful and Japan was nearing disaster.[69]', ""In early 1945, in the wake of the losses in the Battle of Leyte, Emperor Hirohito began a series of individual meetings with senior government officials to consider the progress of the war. All but ex-Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe advised continuing the war. Konoe feared a communist revolution even more than defeat in war and urged a negotiated surrender. In February 1945, during the first private audience with Hirohito he had been allowed in three years,[70][incomplete short citation] Konoe advised Hirohito to begin negotiations to end the war. According to Grand Chamberlain Hisanori Fujita, Hirohito, still looking for a tennozan (a great victory) in order to provide a stronger bargaining position, firmly rejected Konoe's recommendation.[71][incomplete short citation]"", ""With each passing week victory became less likely. In April, the Soviet Union issued notice that it would not renew its neutrality agreement. Japan's ally Germany surrendered in early May 1945. In June, the cabinet reassessed the war strategy, only to decide more firmly than ever on a fight to the last man. This strategy was officially affirmed at a brief Imperial Council meeting, at which, as was normal, Hirohito did not speak."", 'The following day, Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Kōichi Kido prepared a draft document which summarized the hopeless military situation and proposed a negotiated settlement. Extremists in Japan were also calling for a death-before-dishonor mass suicide, modeled on the ""47 Ronin"" incident. By mid-June 1945, the cabinet had agreed to approach the Soviet Union to act as a mediator for a negotiated surrender but not before Japan\'s bargaining position had been improved by repulse of the anticipated Allied invasion of mainland Japan.', 'On 22 June, Hirohito met with his ministers saying, ""I desire that concrete plans to end the war, unhampered by existing policy, be speedily studied and that efforts be made to implement them."" The attempt to negotiate a peace via the Soviet Union came to nothing. There was always the threat that extremists would carry out a coup or foment other violence. On 26 July 1945, the Allies issued the Potsdam Declaration demanding unconditional surrender. The Japanese government council, the Big Six, considered that option and recommended to Hirohito that it be accepted only if one to four conditions were agreed upon, including a guarantee of Hirohito\'s continued position in Japanese society.', 'That changed after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Soviet declaration of war. On 9 August, Emperor Hirohito told Kōichi Kido: ""The Soviet Union has declared war and today began hostilities against us.""[72] On 10 August, the cabinet drafted an ""Imperial Rescript ending the War"" following Hirohito\'s indications that the declaration did not compromise any demand which prejudiced his prerogatives as a sovereign ruler.', 'On 12 August 1945, Hirohito informed the imperial family of his decision to surrender. One of his uncles, Prince Yasuhiko Asaka, asked whether the war would be continued if the kokutai (national polity) could not be preserved. Hirohito simply replied ""Of course.""[73] On 14 August, Hirohito made the decision to surrender ""unconditionally""[74] and the Suzuki government notified the Allies that it had accepted the Potsdam Declaration.', 'On 15 August, a recording of Hirohito\'s surrender speech was broadcast over the radio (the first time Hirohito was heard on the radio by the Japanese people) announcing Japan\'s acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration. During the historic broadcast Hirohito stated: ""Moreover, the enemy has begun to employ a new and most cruel bomb, the power of which to do damage is, indeed, incalculable, taking the toll of many innocent lives. Should we continue to fight, not only would it result in an ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization."" The speech also noted that ""the war situation has developed not necessarily to Japan\'s advantage"" and ordered the Japanese to ""endure the unendurable."" The speech, using formal, archaic Japanese, was not readily understood by many commoners. According to historian Richard Storry in A History of Modern Japan, Hirohito typically used ""a form of language familiar only to the well-educated"" and to the more traditional samurai families.[75]', ""A faction of the army opposed to the surrender attempted a coup d'état on the evening of 14 August, prior to the broadcast. They seized the Imperial Palace (the Kyūjō incident), but the physical recording of Hirohito's speech was hidden and preserved overnight. The coup failed, and the speech was broadcast the next morning.[76]"", 'In his first ever press conference given in Tokyo in 1975, when he was asked what he thought of the bombing of Hiroshima, Hirohito answered: ""It\'s very regrettable that nuclear bombs were dropped and I feel sorry for the citizens of Hiroshima but it couldn\'t be helped because that happened in wartime"" (shikata ga nai, meaning ""it cannot be helped"").[77][incomplete short citation][78]', 'After the Japanese surrender in August 1945, there was a large amount of pressure that came from both Allied countries and Japanese leftists that demanded Hirohito step down and be indicted as a war criminal.[79] Australia, Britain and 70 percent of the American public wanted Hirohito tried as a Class-A war criminal.[80][81] General Douglas MacArthur did not like the idea, as he thought that an ostensibly cooperating emperor would help establish a peaceful allied occupation regime in Japan.[82][83] MacArthur saw Hirohito as a symbol of the continuity and cohesion of the Japanese people. To avoid the possibility of civil unrest in Japan, any possible evidence that would incriminate Hirohito and his family were excluded from the International Military Tribunal for the Far East.[82] MacArthur created a plan that separated Hirohito from the militarists, retained Hirohito as a constitutional monarch but only as a figurehead, and used Hirohito to retain control over Japan to help achieve American postwar objectives in Japan.[83]', 'As Hirohito appointed his uncle and daughter\'s father-in-law, Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni as the Prime Minister to replace Kantarō Suzuki, who resigned owing to responsibility for the surrender, to assist the American occupation, there were attempts by numerous leaders to have him put on trial for alleged war crimes. Many members of the imperial family, such as Princes Chichibu, Takamatsu, and Higashikuni, pressured Hirohito to abdicate so that one of the Princes could serve as regent until his eldest son, Crown Prince Akihito came of age.[84][incomplete short citation] On 27 February 1946, Hirohito\'s youngest brother, Prince Mikasa, even stood up in the privy council and indirectly urged Hirohito to step down and accept responsibility for Japan\'s defeat. According to Minister of Welfare Ashida\'s diary, ""Everyone seemed to ponder Mikasa\'s words. Never have I seen His Majesty\'s face so pale.""[85]', 'Before the war crime trials actually convened, the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, its International Prosecution Section (IPS) and Japanese officials worked behind the scenes not only to prevent the Imperial family from being indicted, but also to influence the testimony of the defendants to ensure that no one implicated Hirohito. High officials in court circles and the Japanese government collaborated with Allied General Headquarters in compiling lists of prospective war criminals, while the individuals arrested as Class A suspects and incarcerated solemnly vowed to protect their sovereign against any possible taint of war responsibility.[86] Thus, ""months before the Tokyo tribunal commenced, MacArthur\'s highest subordinates were working to attribute ultimate responsibility for Pearl Harbor to Hideki Tōjō""[87] by allowing ""the major criminal suspects to coordinate their stories so that Hirohito would be spared from indictment.""[88] According to John W. Dower, ""This successful campaign to absolve Hirohito of war responsibility knew no bounds. Hirohito was not merely presented as being innocent of any formal acts that might make him culpable to indictment as a war criminal, he was turned into an almost saintly figure who did not even bear moral responsibility for the war.""[89] According to Bix, ""MacArthur\'s truly extraordinary measures to save Hirohito from trial as a war criminal had a lasting and profoundly distorting impact on Japanese understanding of the lost war.""[90][incomplete short citation]', ""Historian Gary J. Bass presented evidence supporting Hirohito's responsibility in the war, noting that had he been prosecuted as some judges and others advocated, a compelling case could have been constructed against him. However, the Americans were apprehensive that removing the emperor from power and subjecting him to trial could trigger widespread chaos and collapse of Japan, given his revered status among the Japanese populace.[91] Additionally, the advent of the Cold War brought about harsh political circumstances. Chiang Kai-shek's Chinese nationalists were losing the Chinese Civil War to Mao Zedong's Chinese Communist Party, prompting the Truman administration to consider the potential loss of China as an ally and strategic partner. As a result, ensuring Japan's strength and stability became imperative for securing a reliable postwar ally.[91]"", 'Hirohito was not put on trial, but he was forced[92] to explicitly reject the quasi-official claim that Hirohito of Japan was an arahitogami, i.e., an incarnate divinity. This was motivated by the fact that, according to the Japanese constitution of 1889, Hirohito had a divine power over his country which was derived from the Shinto belief that the Japanese Imperial Family were the descendants of the sun goddess Amaterasu. Hirohito was however persistent in the idea that the Emperor of Japan should be considered a descendant of the gods. In December 1945, he told his vice-grand-chamberlain Michio Kinoshita: ""It is permissible to say that the idea that the Japanese are descendants of the gods is a false conception; but it is absolutely impermissible to call chimerical the idea that the Emperor is a descendant of the gods.""[93] In any case, the ""renunciation of divinity"" was noted more by foreigners than by Japanese, and seems to have been intended for the consumption of the former.[d] The theory of a constitutional monarchy had already had some proponents in Japan. In 1935, when Tatsukichi Minobe advocated the theory that sovereignty resides in the state, of which the Emperor is just an organ (the tennō kikan setsu), it caused a furor. He was forced to resign from the House of Peers and his post at the Tokyo Imperial University, his books were banned, and an attempt was made on his life.[94] Not until 1946 was the tremendous step made to alter the Emperor\'s title from ""imperial sovereign"" to ""constitutional monarch.""[95]', 'Although the Emperor had supposedly repudiated claims to divinity, his public position was deliberately left vague, partly because General MacArthur thought him probable to be a useful partner to get the Japanese to accept the occupation and partly owing to behind-the-scenes maneuvering by Shigeru Yoshida to thwart attempts to cast him as a European-style monarch.', 'Nevertheless, Hirohito\'s status as a limited constitutional monarch was formalized with the enactment of the 1947 constitution–officially, an amendment to the Meiji Constitution. It defined the Emperor as ""the symbol of the state and the unity of the people."" His role was redefined as entirely ceremonial and representative, without even nominal governmental powers. He was limited to performing matters of state as delineated in the Constitution, and in most cases his actions in that realm were carried out in accordance with the binding instructions of the Cabinet. In 1947, Hirohito became the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people under the nation\'s new constitution, which was written by the United States.[96]', 'Following the Iranian Revolution and the end of the short-lived Central African Empire, both in 1979, Hirohito found himself the last monarch in the world to bear any variation of the highest royal title ""emperor.""', 'He was not only the first reigning Japanese emperor to visit foreign countries, but also the first to meet an American president.[97][98] His status and image became strongly positive in the United States.[99]', 'The talks between Emperor Hirohito and President Nixon were not planned at the outset, because initially the stop in the United States was only for refueling to visit Europe. However, the meeting was decided in a hurry at the request of the United States. Although the Japanese side accepted the request, Minister for Foreign Affairs Takeo Fukuda made a public telephone call to the Japanese ambassador to the United States Nobuhiko Ushiba, who promoted talks, saying, ""that will cause me a great deal of trouble. We want to correct the perceptions of the other party."" At that time, Foreign Minister Fukuda was worried that President Nixon\'s talks with Hirohito would be used to repair the deteriorating Japan–U.S. relations, and he was concerned that the premise of the symbolic emperor system could fluctuate.[100][101]', 'There was an early visit with deep royal exchanges in Denmark and Belgium. In France, Hirohito was warmly welcomed, and reunited with Edward VIII, who had abdicated in 1936 and was virtually in exile, and they chatted for a while. However, protests were held in Britain and the Netherlands by veterans who had served in the South-East Asian theatre of World War II and civilian victims of the brutal occupation there. In the Netherlands, raw eggs and vacuum flasks were thrown. The protest was so severe that Empress Nagako, who accompanied the Emperor, was exhausted. In the United Kingdom, protestors stood in silence and turned their backs when Hirohito\'s carriage passed them while others wore red gloves to symbolize the dead.[102] The satirical magazine Private Eye used a racist double entendre to refer to Hirohito\'s visit (""nasty Nip in the air"").[103] In West Germany, the Japanese monarch\'s visit was met with hostile far-left protests, participants of which viewed Hirohito as the East Asian equivalent of Adolf Hitler and referred to him as ""Hirohitler"", and prompted a wider comparative discussion of the memory and perception of Axis war crimes. The protests against Hirohito\'s visit also condemned and highlighted what they perceived as mutual Japanese and West German complicity in and enabling of the American war effort against communism in Vietnam.[104]', 'Regarding these protests and opposition, Emperor Hirohito was not surprised to have received a report in advance at a press conference on 12 November after returning to Japan and said that ""I do not think that welcome can be ignored"" from each country.[105] Also, at a press conference following their golden wedding anniversary three years later, along with the Empress, he mentioned this visit to Europe as his most enjoyable memory in 50 years.[105]', 'In 1975, Hirohito and Nagako visited the United States for 14 days from 30 September to 14 October, at the invitation of President Gerald Ford. The visit was the first such event in US–Japanese history.[e] The United States Army, Navy and Air Force, as well as the Marine Corps and the Coast Guard honored the state visit. Before and after the visit, a series of terrorist attacks in Japan were caused by anti-American left-wing organizations such as the East Asia Anti-Japan Armed Front.', 'After arriving in Williamsburg on 30 September 1975, Emperor Hirohito and Empress Nagako stayed in the United States for two weeks.[106] The official meeting with President Ford occurred on 2 October.[107] On 3 October, Hirohito visited Arlington National Cemetery.[108] On 6 October, Emperor Hirohito and Empress Nagako visited Vice President and Mrs. Rockefeller at their home in Westchester County, New York.[109]', 'In a speech at the White House state dinner, Hirohito read, ""Thanks to the United States for helping to rebuild Japan after the war."" During his stay in Los Angeles, he visited Disneyland, and a smiling photo next to Mickey Mouse adorned the newspapers,[110] and there was talk about the purchase of a Mickey Mouse watch. Two types of commemorative stamps and stamp sheets were issued on the day of their return to Japan[citation needed] which demonstrated that the visit had been a significant undertaking. This was the last visit of Emperor Shōwa to the United States. The official press conference held by the Emperor and Empress before and after their visit also marked a breakthrough.[citation needed]', 'Hirohito was deeply interested in and well-informed about marine biology, and the Tokyo Imperial Palace contained a laboratory from which Hirohito published several papers in the field under his personal name ""Hirohito"".[111] His contributions included the description of several dozen species of Hydrozoa new to science.[112]', 'Hirohito maintained an official boycott of the Yasukuni Shrine after it was revealed to him that Class-A war criminals had secretly been enshrined after its post-war rededication. This boycott lasted from 1978 until his death and has been continued by his successors, Akihito and Naruhito.[113]', 'On 20 July 2006, Nihon Keizai Shimbun published a front-page article about the discovery of a memorandum detailing the reason that Hirohito stopped visiting Yasukuni. The memorandum, kept by former chief of Imperial Household Agency Tomohiko Tomita, confirms for the first time that the enshrinement of 14 Class-A war criminals in Yasukuni was the reason for the boycott. Tomita recorded in detail the contents of his conversations with Hirohito in his diaries and notebooks. According to the memorandum, in 1988, Hirohito expressed his strong displeasure at the decision made by Yasukuni Shrine to include Class-A war criminals in the list of war dead honored there by saying, ""At some point, Class-A criminals became enshrined, including Matsuoka and Shiratori. I heard Tsukuba acted cautiously."" Tsukuba is believed to refer to Fujimaro Tsukuba, the former chief Yasukuni priest at the time, who decided not to enshrine the war criminals despite having received in 1966 the list of war dead compiled by the government. ""What\'s on the mind of Matsudaira\'s son, who is the current head priest?"" ""Matsudaira had a strong wish for peace, but the child didn\'t know the parent\'s heart. That\'s why I have not visited the shrine since. This is my heart."" Matsudaira is believed to refer to Yoshitami Matsudaira, who was the grand steward of the Imperial Household immediately after the end of World War II. His son, Nagayoshi, succeeded Fujimaro Tsukuba as the chief priest of Yasukuni and decided to enshrine the war criminals in 1978.[114]', 'On 22 September 1987, Hirohito underwent surgery on his pancreas after having digestive problems for several months. The doctors discovered that he had duodenal cancer. Hirohito appeared to be making a full recovery for several months after the surgery. About a year later, however, on 19 September 1988, he collapsed in his palace, and his health worsened over the next several months as he suffered from continuous internal bleeding.', ""The Emperor died at 6:33 am on 7 January 1989 at the age of 87. The announcement from the grand steward of Japan's Imperial Household Agency, Shoichi Fujimori, revealed details about his cancer for the first time. Hirohito was survived by his wife, his five surviving children, ten grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.[26]"", 'At the time of his death, he was both the oldest and longest-reigning historical Japanese emperor, as well as the longest-reigning living monarch in the world at that time, a distinction which passed to the Prince of Liechtenstein, Franz Joseph II, until his own death in November of the same year.[115]', 'The Emperor was succeeded by his eldest son, Akihito (r.\u20091989–2019), whose enthronement ceremony was held on 12 November 1990 at the Tokyo Imperial Palace.[116][117]', 'Hirohito\'s death ended the Shōwa era. On the next day, 8 January 1989, a new era began: the Heisei era, effective at midnight the following day. From 7 January until 31 January, Hirohito\'s formal appellation was ""Departed Emperor"" (大行天皇, Taikō-tennō). His definitive posthumous name, Emperor Shōwa (昭和天皇, Shōwa-tennō), was determined on 13 January and formally released on 31 January by Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.[citation needed]', ""On 24 February, Hirohito's state funeral was held at the Shinjuku Gyo-en, and unlike that of his predecessor, it was formal but not conducted in a strictly Shinto manner. A large number of world leaders attended the funeral. Hirohito is buried in the Musashi Imperial Graveyard in Hachiōji, Tokyo alongside his late parents, Emperor Taishō and Empress Teimei, and his wife, Empress Nagako, who died in 2000."", 'The issue of Emperor Hirohito\'s war responsibility is contested.[118] During the war, the Allies frequently depicted Hirohito to equate with Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini as the three Axis dictators.[119] After the war, since the U.S. thought that the retention of the emperor would help establish a peaceful allied occupation regime in Japan, and help the U.S. achieve their postwar objectives, they depicted Hirohito as a ""powerless figurehead"" without any implication in wartime policies.[83] Starting with the publication of specific archival records in the 1960s and continuing after Hirohito\'s death in 1989, a growing body of evidence and historical studies started to dispute the theory that he was a powerless figurehead.[119][120][121] In recent years, the debate over the Emperor\'s role in the war has focused on the exact extent of his involvement in political and military affairs (as it is now widely accepted that he had at least some degree of involvement).[122][1] ', 'Historian Peter Wetzler said that: ', '""The debate, however, about Hirohito\'s participation in political and military affairs during the Second World War -whether or not (at first) and to what extent (later)- still continues. It will animate authors for years to come. Now most historians acknowledge that the Emperor was deeply involved, like all nation-state leaders at that time.""[122]', ' Jennifer Lind, associate professor of government at Dartmouth College and a specialist in Japanese war memory, states that: ', '""Over the years, these different pieces of evidence have trickled out and historians have amassed this picture of culpability and how he was reflecting on that. This is another piece of the puzzle that very much confirms that the picture that was taking place before, which is that he was extremely culpable, and after the war he was devastated about this.""[1]', "" As new evidence surfaced over the years, historians concluded that he bore at least some amount of culpability for the war's outbreak and the crimes perpetrated by Japan's military during that period.[122][1][123]"", 'Historians who point to a higher degree of the Emperor\'s involvement in the war have stated that Hirohito was directly responsible for the atrocities committed by the imperial forces in the Second Sino-Japanese War and in World War II. They have said that he and some members of the imperial family, such as his brother Prince Chichibu, his cousins the princes Takeda and Fushimi, and his uncles the princes Kan\'in, Asaka, and Higashikuni, should have been tried for war crimes.[124][page\xa0needed][125][incomplete short citation] In a study published in 1996, historian Mitsuyoshi Himeta said that the Three Alls policy (Sankō Sakusen), a Japanese scorched earth policy adopted in China and sanctioned by Emperor Hirohito himself, was both directly and indirectly responsible for the deaths of ""more than 2.7 million"" Chinese civilians. In Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan, Herbert P. Bix said the Sankō Sakusen far surpassed Nanking Massacre not only in terms of numbers, but in brutality. According to Bix, ""[t]hese military operations caused death and suffering on a scale incomparably greater than the totally unplanned orgy of killing in Nanking, which later came to symbolize the war"".[126] While the Nanking Massacre was unplanned, Bix said ""Hirohito knew of and approved annihilation campaigns in China that included burning villages thought to harbor guerrillas.""[127] Likewise,  in August 2000, the Los Angeles Times reported that top U.S. government officials were fully aware of the emperor\'s intimate role during the war.[128]', ""According to Yuki Tanaka, Emeritus Research Professor of History at Hiroshima City University, the war records at the Defense Agency National Institute provide evidence that Hirohito was heavily involved in creating war policies.[129] He further stated that Japanese statesmen Kido Kōichi's wartime journal undeniably proves that Hirohito had a crucial role in the final decision to wage a war against the Allied nations in December 1941.[129]"", ""According to Francis Pike, Hirohito was deeply engaged in military operations and commissioned a war room beneath the Tokyo Imperial Palace to closely monitor Japan's military activities.[130] Pike further noted that the extensive resources required for regular updates to the Emperor often drew complaints from military officials.[130] To celebrate significant military victories, he rode his white horse in parades in front of the Imperial Palace.[130]"", 'According to Peter Wetzler, he was actively involved in the decision to launch the war as well as in other political and military decisions.[93] ', 'Poison gas weapons, such as phosgene, were produced by Unit 731 and authorized by specific orders given by Hirohito himself, transmitted by the chief of staff of the army. Hirohito authorized the use of toxic gas 375 times during the Battle of Wuhan from August to October 1938.[118] He rewarded Shiro Ishii, who was the head of the medical experimentation unit and Unit 731, with a special service medal.[131]', 'Prince Mikasa, the younger brother of Hirohito, informed the Yomiuri Shimbun that during 1944, he compiled a thorough report detailing the wartime atrocities perpetrated by Japanese soldiers in China.[132] He clarified that he didn\'t directly discuss the report with Hirohito;however, he added that ""when I met with him, I did report on the China situation in bits and pieces.""[132]  Additionally, he recalled showing Hirohito a Chinese-produced film depicting Japanese atrocities.[132]', 'Officially, the imperial constitution, adopted under Emperor Meiji, gave full power to the Emperor. Article 4 prescribed that, ""The Emperor is the head of the Empire, combining in Himself the rights of sovereignty, and exercises them, according to the provisions of the present Constitution."" Likewise, according to article 6, ""The Emperor gives sanction to laws and orders them to be promulgated and executed,"" and article 11, ""The Emperor has the supreme command of the Army and the Navy."" The Emperor was thus the leader of the Imperial General Headquarters.[133]', ""According to Bob Tadashi Wakabayashi of York University, Hirohito's authority up to 1945 depended on three elements: "", ' First, he was a constitutional monarch subject to legal restrictions and binding conventions, as he has so often stressed. Second, he was supreme commander of Japanese armed forces, though his orders were often ignored and sometimes defied. Third, he wielded absolute moral authority in Japan by granting imperial honors that conveyed incontestable prestige and by issuing imperial rescripts that had coercive power greater than law. [¶] In the postwar era, the Japanese Government, some Japanese historians, and Hirohito himself have downplayed or ignored these second and third elements, where were strongest up to 1945; and they have overemphasized the first, which was weakest. Hirohito was no despot. But he did retain \'absolute\' power in the sense of ultimate and final authority to sanction a particular policy decision by agreeing with it, or to force its reformulation or abandonment by disagreeing with it. When he really wanted to put his foot down, he did –– even to the army.""[134]', 'Wakabayashi further adds:', '...as a matter of course, [Hirohito] wanted to keep what his generals conquered -- though he was less greedy than some of them. None of this should surprise us. Hirohito would no more have granted Korea independence or returned Manchuria to China than Roosevelt would have granted Hawaii independence or returned Texas to Mexico.[135]', 'Historians such as Herbert Bix, Akira Fujiwara, Peter Wetzler, and Akira Yamada assert that post-war arguments favoring the view that Hirohito was a mere figurehead overlook the importance of numerous ""behind the chrysanthemum curtain"" meetings where the real decisions were made between the Emperor, his chiefs of staff, and the cabinet. Using primary sources and the monumental work of Shirō Hara as a basis,[f] Fujiwara[136] and Wetzler[137] have produced evidence suggesting that the Emperor actively participated in making political and military decisions and was neither bellicose nor a pacifist but an opportunist who governed in a pluralistic decision-making process. Historian Peter Wetzler states that the emperor was thoroughly informed of military matters, and comensurate with his position and Japanese methods of forming policies, he participated in making political and military decisions as the constitutional emperor of Imperial Japan and head of the imperial house.[138] For his part, American historian Herbert P. Bix maintains that Emperor Hirohito worked through intermediaries to exercise a great deal of control over the military and might have been the prime mover behind most of Japan\'s military aggression during the Shōwa era.[125][page\xa0needed]', 'The view promoted by the Imperial Palace and American occupation forces immediately after World War II portrayed Emperor Hirohito as a purely ceremonial figure who behaved strictly according to protocol while remaining at a distance from the decision-making processes. This view was endorsed by Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita in a speech on the day of Hirohito\'s death in which Takeshita asserted that the war ""had broken out against [Hirohito\'s] wishes."" Takeshita\'s statement provoked outrage in nations in East Asia and Commonwealth nations such as the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.[139] According to historian Fujiwara, ""The thesis that the Emperor, as an organ of responsibility, could not reverse cabinet decision is a myth fabricated after the war.""[140]', ""According to Yinan He, associate professor of international relations at Lehigh University,[141] allied countries and Japanese leftists demanded the emperor to abdicate and be tried as a war criminal.[79] However, conservative Japanese elites concocted jingoistic myths that exonerated the nation's ruling class and downplayed Japan's wartime culpability.[79] Such revisionist campaigns depicted the Emperor as a peace-seeking diplomat, while blaming the militarists for hijacking the government and leading the country into a disastrous war.[79] This narrative sought to exonerate the Emperor by shifting responsibility onto a small group of military leaders.[79] Furthermore, numerous Japanese conservative elites lobbied the United States to spare the emperor from war crimes investigations and advocated instead for the prosecution of General Hideki Tojo, who held office as prime minister for most of the Pacific War.[79] This narrative also narrowly focuses on the U.S.–Japan conflict, completely ignores the wars Japan waged in Asia, and disregards the atrocities committed by Japanese troops during the war.[79] Japanese elites created the narrative in an attempt to avoid tarnishing the national image and regain the international acceptance of the country.[79]"", 'Kentarō Awaya\xa0[Wikidata] said that post-war Japanese public opinion supporting protection of the Emperor was influenced by United States propaganda promoting the view that the Emperor together with the Japanese people had been fooled by the military.[142]', 'In the years immediately after Hirohito\'s death, scholars who spoke out against the emperor were threatened and attacked by right-wing extremists. Susan Chira reported, ""Scholars who have spoken out against the late Emperor have received threatening phone calls from Japan\'s extremist right wing.""[139] One example of actual violence occurred in 1990 when the mayor of Nagasaki, Hitoshi Motoshima, was shot and critically wounded by a member of the ultranationalist group, Seikijuku. A year before, in 1989, Motoshima had broken what was characterized as ""one of [Japan\'s] most sensitive taboos"" by asserting that Emperor Hirohito bore responsibility for World War II.[143]', 'Regarding Hirohito\'s exemption from trial before the International Military Tribunal of the Far East, opinions were not unanimous. Sir William Webb, the president of the tribunal, declared: ""This immunity of the Emperor is contrasted with the part he played in launching the war in the Pacific, is, I think, a matter which the tribunal should take into consideration in imposing the sentences.""[144] Likewise, the French judge, Henri Bernard, wrote about Hirohito\'s accountability that the declaration of war by Japan ""had a principal author who escaped all prosecution and of whom in any case the present defendants could only be considered accomplices.""[145]', 'An account from the Vice Interior Minister in 1941, Michio Yuzawa, asserts that Hirohito was ""at ease"" with the attack on Pearl Harbor ""once he had made a decision.""[146]', ""Since his death in 1989, historians have discovered evidence that prove Hirohito's culpability for the war, and that he was not a passive figurehead manipulated by those around him.[79]"", 'In December 1990, the Bungeishunjū published the Showa tenno dokuhaku roku (Dokuhaku roku), which recorded conversations Hirohito held with five Imperial Household Ministry officials between March and April 1946, containing twenty-four sections.[147] The Dokuhaku roku recorded Hirohito speaking retroactively on topics arranged chronologically from 1919 to 1946, right before the Tokyo War Crimes Trials.[147]', ""In Hirohito's monologue: "", ""It doesn't matter much if an incident occurs in Manchuria, as it is rural; however, if something were to happen in the Tientsin-Peking area, Anglo-American intervention would likely worsen and could lead to a clash.[148]"", ""While he could justify the aggression of his military in China's northeastern provinces, he lacked confidence in Japan's capacity to win a war against the United States and Britain. He was also more aware than his military commanders of Japan's vulnerability to an economic blockade by Western powers.[148]"", 'Japan signed the Tripartite Pact in 1940 and another agreement in December 1941 that forbade Japan from signing a separate peace treaty with the United States.[149] In the Dokuhaku roku, Hirohito said:', '(In 1941,) we thought we could achieve a draw with the US, or at best win by a six to four margin; but total victory was nearly impossible ... When the war actually began, however, we gained a miraculous victory at Pearl Harbor and our invasions of Malaya and Burma succeeded far quicker than expected. So, if not for this (agreement), we might have achieved peace when we were in an advantageous position.[149]', ""The passage in the Dokuhaku roku refutes the theory that Hirohito wanted an early conclusion to the war owing to his value for peace. Instead, it provides evidence that he desired its end because of Japan's early military victories in Pearl Harbor and Southeast Asia.[149]"", 'In September 1944, Prime Minister Kuniaki Koiso proposed that a settlement and concessions, such as the return of Hong Kong, should be given to Chiang Kai-shek, so that Japanese troops in China could be diverted to the Pacific War.[150] Hirohito rejected the proposal and did not want to give concessions to China because he feared it would signal Japanese weakness, create defeatism at home, and trigger independence movements in occupied countries.[151]', 'As the war shifted unfavorably for Japan, his sentiments were recorded in the Dokuhaku roku as follows:', "" I hoped to give the enemy one good bashing somewhere, and then seize a chance for peace. Yet I didn't want to ask for peace before Germany did because then we would lose trust in the international community for having violated that corollary agreement.[152]"", 'As the war front progressed northward, Hirohito persistently hoped for the Japanese military to deliver a ""good bashing"" at some point during the war, which meant securing a decisive victory and then leveraging that success to negotiate the most favorable terms possible for Japan.[153] In the autumn of 1944, he hoped for a victory at Battle of Leyte Gulf, but Japan suffered defeat.[149] On 14 February 1945, Fumimaro Konoe wrote a proposal to Hirohito, urging him to quell extremist elements within the military and end the war.[149] Konoe argued that although surrendering to America might preserve imperial rule, it would not survive a communist revolution he believed was imminent.[149] Hirohito was troubled by the ambiguity surrounding America\'s commitment to upholding imperial rule.[149] He considered the advice of Army Chief of Staff Yoshijirō Umezu, who advocated for continuing the fight to the bitter end, believing that the Americans could be lured into a trap on Taiwan, where they could be defeated.[149] However, the Americans avoided Taiwan.[149] Despite the defeat at the Battle of Okinawa and acknowledging Japan\'s imminent unconditional surrender following this defeat, Hirohito persisted in seeking another battlefield where a ""good bashing"" could be achieved, considering locations such as Yunnan or Burma.[149]', 'In August 1945, Hirohito agreed to the Potsdam Declaration because he thought that the American occupation of Japan would uphold imperial rule in Japan.[147]', 'Shinobu Kobayashi was the Emperor\'s chamberlain from April 1974 until June 2000. Kobayashi kept a diary with near-daily remarks of Hirohito for 26 years. It was made public on Wednesday 22 August 2018.[154] According to Takahisa Furukawa, a professor of modern Japanese history at Nihon University, the diary reveals that the emperor ""gravely took responsibility for the war for a long time, and as he got older, that feeling became stronger.""[1]', 'Jennifer Lind, associate professor of government at Dartmouth College and a specialist in Japanese war memory said:', '""Over the years, these different pieces of evidence have trickled out and historians have amassed this picture of culpability and how he was reflecting on that.

The bookseller said: ""It took me nine years to come forward, as I was afraid of a backlash. But now I hope the memo would help us figure out what really happened during the war, in which 3.1 million people were killed.""[146]', 'Takahisa Furukawa, expert on wartime history from Nihon University, confirmed the authenticity of the memo, calling it ""the first look at the thinking of Emperor Hirohito and Prime Minister Hideki Tojo on the eve of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.""[146]', 'In this document, Yuzawa details a conversation he had with Tojo a few hours before the attack.

Pal said there is ""no evidence, testimonial or circumstantial, concomitant, prospectant, restrospectant, that would in any way lead to the inference that the government in any way permitted the commission of such offenses"".[159] He added that conspiracy to wage aggressive war was not illegal in 1937, or at any point since.[159] Pal supported the acquittal of all of the defendants. He considered the Japanese military operations as justified, because Chiang Kai-shek supported the boycott of trade operations by the Western Powers, particularly the United States boycott of oil exports to Japan. Pal argued the attacks on neighboring territories were justified to protect the Japanese Empire from an aggressive environment, especially the Soviet Union. He considered that to be self-defense operations which are not criminal. Pal said ""the real culprits are not before us"" and concluded that ""only a lost war is an international crime"".', 'A January 1989 declassified British government assessment of Hirohito said the Emperor was ""uneasy with Japan\'s drift to war in the 1930s and 1940s but was too weak to alter the course of events."" The dispatch by John Whitehead, former ambassador of the United Kingdom to Japan, to Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe was declassified on Thursday 20 July 2017 at the National Archives in London. The letter was written shortly after Hirohito\'s death.Britain\'s ambassador to Japan John Whitehead stated in 1989:[157]', '""By personality and temperament, Hirohito was ill-suited to the role assigned to him by destiny. The successors of the men who had led the Meiji Restoration yearned for a charismatic warrior king. Instead, they were given an introspective prince who grew up to be more at home in the science laboratory than on the military parade ground. But in his early years, every effort was made to cast him in a different mould.""[157]', '""A man of stronger personality than Hirohito might have tried more strenuously to check the growing influence of the military in Japanese politics and the drift of Japan toward war with the western powers."" ""The contemporary diary evidence suggests that Hirohito was uncomfortable with the direction of Japanese policy."" ""The consensus of those who have studied the documents of the period is that Hirohito was consistent in attempting to use his personal influence to induce caution and to moderate and even obstruct the growing impetus toward war.""[157]', 'Whitehead concludes that ultimately Hirohito was ""powerless"" and comparisons with Hitler are ""ridiculously wide off the mark."" If Hirohito acted too insistently with his views he could have been isolated or replaced with a more pliant member of the royal family. The pre-war Meiji Constitution defined Hirohito as ""sacred"" and all-powerful, but according to Whitehead, Hirohito\'s power was limited by ministers and the military. Whitehead explained after World War II that Hirohito\'s humility was fundamental for the Japanese people to accept the new 1947 constitution and allied occupation.[157]', 'Emperor Shōwa and Empress Kōjun had seven children (two sons and five daughters).', 'Unless otherwise noted (as BC), years are in CE\xa0/ AD\xa0 * Imperial Consort and Regent Empress Jingū is not traditionally listed.']","Hirohito[a] (29 April 1901 – 7 January 1989), posthumously honored as Emperor Shōwa,[b] was the 124th emperor of Japan according to the traditional order of succession, reigning from 1926 until his death in 1989. He was the longest-reigning Japanese emperor and one of the world's longest-reigning monarchs. As emperor during the Shōwa era, Hirohito oversaw the rise of Japanese militarism, Japan's expansionism in Asia, the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II, and the postwar Japanese economic miracle. ","There appears to be a mix of quotes from various sources, but none of them seem to contradict each other significantly. However, I can try to provide some context and clarify any inconsistencies.

The quotes suggest that Hirohito's role as Emperor was more limited than initially thought, with many observers now believing that he was not the primary decision-maker behind Japan's aggressive actions during World War II.

Seiichi Chadani, a professor of modern Japanese history, suggests that Hirohito's aides expressed concerns about his willingness to pursue war, but there is no mention of him trying to stop the Emperor from going too far.

The January 1989 British government assessment describes Hirohito as ""too weak to alter the course of events"" and states that he was powerless in shaping Japan's policy. This seems to contradict the idea that Hirohito was a strong leader who could have tried more strenuously to check the growing influence of the military.

However, John Whitehead, the former ambassador of the United Kingdom to Japan, suggests that Hirohito was uncomfortable with the direction of Japanese policy and attempted to use his personal influence to induce caution. He also notes that Hirohito's power was limited by ministers and the military.

Radhabinod Pal, an Indian jurist who opposed the International Military Tribunal, argued that there was no evidence to support the conspiracy theory against Japan, and that the country's actions were justified as self-defense operations. This perspective is in contrast to many Western observers, including the British government assessment, which viewed Hirohito's leadership as inadequate.

Overall, it seems that different observers have varying views on Hirohito's role during World War II, reflecting a complex and nuanced understanding of his position and actions.","* Text A emphasizes that Hirohito was ""the longest-reigning Japanese emperor"" (text A), which contradicts the idea presented in text B that his role was more limited.

Joseph_Goebbels,"[""Paul Joseph Goebbels (German: [ˈpaʊ̯l ˈjoːzɛf ˈɡœbl̩s] ⓘ; 29 October 1897\xa0– 1 May 1945) was a German Nazi politician and philologist who was the Gauleiter (district leader) of Berlin, chief propagandist for the Nazi Party, and then Reich Minister of Propaganda from 1933 to 1945. He was one of Adolf Hitler's closest and most devoted followers, known for his skills in public speaking and his deeply virulent antisemitism which was evident in his publicly voiced views. He advocated progressively harsher discrimination, including the extermination of the Jews in the Holocaust."", ""Goebbels, who aspired to be an author, obtained a doctorate in philology from the University of Heidelberg in 1921. He joined the Nazi Party in 1924, and worked with Gregor Strasser in its northern branch. He was appointed Gauleiter of Berlin in 1926, where he began to take an interest in the use of propaganda to promote the party and its programme. After the Nazis came to power in 1933, Goebbels's Propaganda Ministry quickly gained control over the news media, arts and information in Nazi Germany. He was particularly adept at using the relatively new media of radio and film for propaganda purposes. Topics for party propaganda included antisemitism, attacks on Christian churches, and (after the start of the Second World War) attempts to shape morale."", 'In 1943, Goebbels began to pressure Hitler to introduce measures that would produce ""total war"", including closing businesses not essential to the war effort, conscripting women into the labour force, and enlisting men in previously exempt occupations into the Wehrmacht. Hitler finally appointed him as Reich Plenipotentiary for Total War on 23 July 1944, whereby Goebbels undertook largely unsuccessful measures to increase the number of people available for armaments manufacture and the Wehrmacht.', ""As the war drew to a close and Nazi Germany faced defeat, Magda Goebbels and the Goebbels children joined Hitler in Berlin. They moved into the underground Vorbunker, part of Hitler's underground bunker complex, on 22 April 1945. Hitler committed suicide on 30 April. In accordance with Hitler's will, Goebbels succeeded him as Chancellor of Germany; he served one day in this post. The following day, Goebbels and his wife Magda committed suicide, after having poisoned their six children with a cyanide compound."", 'Paul Joseph Goebbels was born on 29 October 1897 in Rheydt, an industrial town south of Mönchengladbach near Düsseldorf, Germany.[1] Both of his parents were Roman Catholics with modest family backgrounds.[1] His father, Fritz, was a German factory clerk; his mother, Katharina Maria (née Odenhausen), was born to Dutch and German parents in a Dutch village close to the border with Germany.[2][3] Goebbels had five siblings: Konrad (1893–1949), Hans (1895–1947), Maria (1896–1896), Elisabeth (1901–1915) and Maria (1910–1949),[1] who married the German filmmaker Max W. Kimmich in 1938.[4] In 1932 Goebbels commissioned the publication of a pamphlet of his family tree to refute the rumours that his maternal grandmother was of Jewish ancestry.[5]', 'During childhood Goebbels experienced ill health, which included a long bout of inflammation of the lungs. He had a deformed right foot, which turned inwards and was due to a congenital disorder. It was thicker and shorter than his left foot.[1] Just prior to starting grammar school he underwent an operation, which failed to correct the problem.[6] Goebbels wore a metal brace and a special shoe because of his shortened leg and walked with a limp. He was rejected for military service in World War I because of this deformity.[7]', 'Goebbels was educated at a Gymnasium, where he completed his Abitur (university entrance examination) in 1917.[8] He was the top student of his class and was given the traditional honour of speaking at the awards ceremony.[9] His parents initially hoped that he would become a Catholic priest, which Goebbels seriously considered.[10] He studied literature and history at the universities of Bonn, Würzburg, Freiburg and Munich,[11] aided by a scholarship from the Albertus Magnus Society.[12] By this time Goebbels had begun to distance himself from the church.[13]', 'Historians, including Richard J. Evans and Roger Manvell, speculate that Goebbels\' lifelong pursuit of women may have been in compensation for his physical disability.[14][15] At Freiburg he met and fell in love with Anka Stalherm, who was three years his senior.[16] She went on to Würzburg to continue studying, as did Goebbels.[7] By 1920 the relationship with Anka was over; the break-up filled Goebbels with thoughts of suicide.[17][a] In 1921 he wrote a semi-autobiographical novel, Michael, a three-part work of which only Parts I and III have survived.[18] Goebbels felt he was writing his ""own story"".[18] Antisemitic content and material about a charismatic leader may have been added by Goebbels shortly before the book was published in 1929 by Eher-Verlag, the publishing house of the Nazi Party (National Socialist German Workers\' Party; NSDAP).[19]', 'At the University of Heidelberg Goebbels wrote his doctoral thesis on Wilhelm von Schütz, a minor 19th-century romantic dramatist.[20] He had hoped to write his thesis under the supervision of Friedrich Gundolf, a literary historian. It did not seem to bother Goebbels that Gundolf was Jewish. As he was no longer teaching, Gundolf directed Goebbels to associate professor Max Freiherr von Waldberg. Waldberg, who was also Jewish, recommended Goebbels write his thesis on Wilhelm von Schütz. After submitting the thesis and passing his oral examination, Goebbels received his PhD on 21 April 1922.[21][22] By 1940 he had written 14 books.[23]', 'Goebbels returned home and worked as a private tutor. He also found work as a journalist and was published in the local newspaper. His writing during that time reflected his growing antisemitism and dislike for modern culture. In the summer of 1922 he met and began a love affair with Else Janke, a schoolteacher.[24] After she revealed to him that she was half-Jewish, Goebbels stated the ""enchantment [was] ruined.""[25] Nevertheless he continued to see her on and off until 1927.[26]', 'He continued for several years to try to become a published author.[27] His diaries, which he began in 1923 and continued for the rest of his life, provided an outlet for his desire to write.[28] The lack of income from his literary works – he wrote two plays in 1923, neither of which sold[29] – forced him to take employment as a caller on the stock exchange and as a bank clerk in Cologne, a job he detested.[30][31] He was dismissed from the bank in August 1923 and returned to Rheydt.[32] During this period he read avidly and was influenced by the works of Oswald Spengler, Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Houston Stewart Chamberlain, the British-born German writer whose book The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century (1899) was one of the standard works of the extreme right in Germany.[33] He also began to study the social question and read the works of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Rosa Luxemburg, August Bebel and Gustav Noske.[34][35] According to German historian Peter Longerich, Goebbels\'s diary entries from late 1923 to early 1924 reflected the writings of a man who was isolated, preoccupied with ""religious-philosophical"" issues and lacked a sense of direction. Diary entries from mid-December 1923 onwards show Goebbels was moving towards the Völkisch nationalist movement.[36]', ""Goebbels first took an interest in Adolf Hitler and Nazism in 1924.[37] In February 1924, Hitler's trial for treason began in the wake of his failed attempt to seize power in the Beer Hall Putsch of 8–9 November 1923.[38] The trial attracted widespread press coverage and gave Hitler a platform for propaganda.[39] Hitler was sentenced to five years in prison, but was released on 20 December 1924, after serving just over a year, including pre-trial detention.[40] Goebbels was drawn to the Nazi Party mostly because of Hitler's charisma and commitment to his beliefs.[41] He joined the Nazi Party around this time, becoming member number 8762.[30] In late 1924, Goebbels offered his services to Karl Kaufmann, who was Gauleiter (Nazi Party district leader) for the Rhine-Ruhr District. Kaufmann put him in touch with Gregor Strasser, a leading Nazi organiser in northern Germany, who hired him to work on their weekly newspaper and undertake secretarial work for the regional party offices.[42] He was also put to work as party speaker and representative for Rhineland-Westphalia.[43] Strasser founded the National Socialist Working Association on 10 September 1925, a short-lived group of about a dozen northern and western German Gauleiter; Goebbels became its business manager and the editor of its biweekly journal, NS-Briefe.[44] Members of Strasser's northern branch of the Nazi Party, including Goebbels, had a more socialist outlook than the rival Hitler group in Munich.[45] Strasser disagreed with Hitler on many parts of the party platform, and in November 1926 began working on a revision.[46]"", 'Hitler viewed Strasser\'s actions as a threat to his authority, and summoned 60\xa0Gauleiters and party leaders, including Goebbels, to a special conference in Bamberg, in Streicher\'s Gau of Franconia, where he gave a two-hour speech repudiating Strasser\'s new political programme.[47] Hitler was opposed to the socialist leanings of the northern wing, stating it would mean ""political bolshevization of Germany."" Further, there would be ""no princes, only Germans,"" and a legal system with no ""Jewish system of exploitation\xa0... for plundering of our people."" The future would be secured by acquiring land, not through expropriation of the estates of the former nobility, but through colonising territories to the east.[46] Goebbels was horrified by Hitler\'s characterisation of socialism as ""a Jewish creation"" and his assertion that a Nazi government would not expropriate private property. He wrote in his diary: ""I no longer fully believe in Hitler. That\'s the terrible thing: my inner support has been taken away.""[48]', 'After reading Hitler\'s book Mein Kampf, Goebbels found himself agreeing with Hitler\'s assertion of a ""Jewish doctrine of Marxism"".[49] In February 1926, Goebbels gave a speech titled ""Bolshevism or National-socialism? Lenin or Hitler?"" in which he asserted that communism or Marxism could not save the German people, but he believed it would cause a ""socialist nationalist state"" to arise in Russia.[50] In 1926, Goebbels published a pamphlet titled Nazi-Sozi which attempted to explain how National Socialism differed from Marxism.[51]', 'In hopes of winning over the opposition, Hitler arranged meetings in Munich with the three Greater Ruhr Gau leaders, including Goebbels.[52] Goebbels was impressed when Hitler sent his own car to meet them at the railway station. That evening, Hitler and Goebbels both gave speeches at a beer hall rally.[52] The following day, Hitler offered his hand in reconciliation to the three men, encouraging them to put their differences behind them.[53] Goebbels capitulated completely, offering Hitler his total loyalty. He wrote in his diary: ""I love him\xa0... He has thought through everything,"" ""Such a sparkling mind can be my leader. I bow to the greater one, the political genius."" He later wrote: ""Adolf Hitler, I love you because you are both great and simple at the same time. What one calls a genius.""[54] As a result of the Bamberg and Munich meetings, the National Socialist Working Association was disbanded.[55] Strasser\'s new draft of the party programme was discarded, the original National Socialist Program of 1920 was retained unchanged, and Hitler\'s position as party leader was greatly strengthened.[54]', ""At Hitler's invitation, Goebbels spoke at party meetings in Munich and at the annual Party Congress, held in Weimar in 1926.[56] For the following year's event, Goebbels was involved in the planning for the first time. He and Hitler arranged for the rally to be filmed.[57] Receiving praise for doing well at these events led Goebbels to shape his political ideas to match Hitler's, and to admire and idolise him even more.[58]"", ""Goebbels was first offered the position of party Gauleiter for the Berlin section in August 1926. He travelled to Berlin in mid-September and by the middle of October accepted the position. Thus Hitler's plan to divide and dissolve the northwestern Gauleiters group that Goebbels had served in under Strasser was successful.[59] Hitler gave Goebbels great authority over the area, allowing him to determine the course for organisation and leadership for the Gau. Goebbels was given control over the local Sturmabteilung (SA) and Schutzstaffel (SS) and answered only to Hitler.[60] The party membership numbered about 1,000 when Goebbels arrived, and he reduced it to a core of 600 of the most active and promising members. To raise money, he instituted membership fees and began charging admission to party meetings.[61] Aware of the value of publicity (both positive and negative), he deliberately provoked beer-hall battles and street brawls, including violent attacks on the Communist Party of Germany (KPD).[62] Goebbels adapted recent developments in commercial advertising to the political sphere, including the use of catchy slogans and subliminal cues.[63] His new ideas for poster design included using large type, red ink, and cryptic headers that encouraged the reader to examine the fine print to determine the meaning.[64]"", 'Like Hitler, Goebbels practised his public speaking skills in front of a mirror. Meetings were preceded by ceremonial marches and singing, and the venues were decorated with party banners. His entrance (almost always late) was timed for maximum emotional impact. Goebbels usually meticulously planned his speeches ahead of time, using pre-planned and choreographed inflection and gestures, but he was also able to improvise and adapt his presentation to make a good connection with his audience.[66][65] He used loudspeakers, decorative flames, uniforms, and marches to attract attention to speeches.[67]', 'Goebbels\' tactic of using provocation to bring attention to the Nazi Party, along with violence at the public party meetings and demonstrations, led the Berlin police to ban the Nazi Party from the city on 5 May 1927.[68][69] Violent incidents continued, including young Nazis randomly attacking Jews in the streets.[65] Goebbels was subjected to a public speaking ban until the end of October.[70] During this period, he founded the newspaper Der Angriff (The Attack) as a propaganda vehicle for the Berlin area, where few supported the party. It was a modern-style newspaper with an aggressive tone;[71] 126 libel suits were pending against Goebbels at one point.[67] To his disappointment, circulation was initially only 2,000. Material in the paper was highly anti-communist and antisemitic.[72] Among the paper\'s favourite targets was the Jewish Deputy Chief of the Berlin Police Bernhard Weiß. Goebbels gave him the derogatory nickname ""Isidore"" and subjected him to a relentless campaign of Jew-baiting in the hope of provoking a crackdown he could then exploit.[73] Goebbels continued to try to break into the literary world, with a revised version of his book Michael finally being published, and the unsuccessful production of two of his plays (Der Wanderer and Die Saat (The Seed)). The latter was his final attempt at playwriting.[74] During this period in Berlin he had relationships with many women, including his old flame Anka Stalherm, who was now married and had a small child. He was quick to fall in love, but easily tired of a relationship and moved on to someone new. He worried too about how a committed personal relationship might interfere with his career.[75]', 'The ban on the Nazi Party was lifted before the Reichstag elections on 20 May 1928.[76] The Nazi Party lost nearly 100,000 voters and earned only 2.6 per cent of the vote nationwide. Results in Berlin were even worse, where they attained only 1.4 per cent of the vote.[77] Goebbels was one of the first 12 Nazi Party members to gain election to the Reichstag.[77] This gave him immunity from prosecution for a long list of outstanding charges, including a three-week jail sentence he received in April for insulting the deputy police chief Weiß.[78] The Reichstag changed the immunity regulations in February 1931, and Goebbels was forced to pay fines for libellous material he had placed in Der Angriff over the course of the previous year.[79] Goebbels continued to be elected to the Reichstag at every subsequent election during the Weimar and Nazi regimes.[80]', ""In his newspaper Berliner Arbeiterzeitung (Berlin Workers Newspaper), Gregor Strasser was highly critical of Goebbels' failure to attract the urban vote.[81] However, the party as a whole did much better in rural areas, attracting as much as 18 per cent of the vote in some regions.[77] This was partly because Hitler had publicly stated just prior to the election that Point 17 of the party programme, which mandated the expropriation of land without compensation, would apply only to Jewish speculators and not private landholders.[82] After the election, the party refocused their efforts to try to attract still more votes in the agricultural sector.[83] In May, shortly after the election, Hitler considered appointing Goebbels as party propaganda chief. But he hesitated, as he worried that the removal of Gregor Strasser from the post would lead to a split in the party. Goebbels considered himself well suited to the position, and began to formulate ideas about how propaganda could be used in schools and the media.[84]"", ""By 1930 Berlin was the party's second-strongest base of support after Munich.[67] That year the violence between the Nazis and communists led to local SA troop leader Horst Wessel being shot by two members of the KPD. He later died in hospital.[87] Exploiting Wessel's death, Goebbels turned him into a martyr for the Nazi movement. He officially declared Wessel's march Die Fahne hoch (Raise the flag), renamed as the Horst-Wessel-Lied, to be the Nazi Party anthem.[85]"", 'The Great Depression greatly impacted Germany and by 1930 there was a dramatic increase in unemployment.[88] During this time, the Strasser brothers started publishing a new daily newspaper in Berlin, the Nationaler Sozialist.[89] Like their other publications, it conveyed the brothers\' own brand of Nazism, including nationalism, anti-capitalism, social reform, and anti-Westernism.[90] Goebbels complained vehemently about the rival Strasser newspapers to Hitler and admitted that their success was causing his own Berlin newspapers to be ""pushed to the wall"".[89] In late April 1930, Hitler publicly and firmly announced his opposition to Gregor Strasser and appointed Goebbels to replace him as Reich leader of Nazi Party propaganda.[91] One of Goebbels\' first acts was to ban the evening edition of the Nationaler Sozialist.[92] Goebbels was also given control of other Nazi papers across the country, including the party\'s national newspaper, the Völkischer Beobachter (People\'s Observer). He still had to wait until 3 July for Otto Strasser and his supporters to announce they were leaving the Nazi Party. Upon receiving the news, Goebbels was relieved the ""crisis"" with the Strassers was finally over and glad that Otto Strasser had lost all power.[93]', ""The rapid deterioration of the economy led to the resignation on 27 March 1930 of the coalition government that had been elected in 1928. Paul von Hindenburg appointed Heinrich Brüning as chancellor.[94] A new cabinet was formed, and Hindenburg used his power as president to govern via emergency decrees.[95] Goebbels took charge of the Nazi Party's national campaign for Reichstag elections called for 14 September 1930. Campaigning was undertaken on a huge scale, with thousands of meetings and speeches held all over the country. Hitler's speeches focused on blaming the country's economic woes on the Weimar Republic, particularly its adherence to the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which required war reparations that had proven devastating to the German economy. He proposed a new German society based on race and national unity. The resulting success took even Hitler and Goebbels by surprise: the party received 6.5 million votes nationwide and took 107 seats in the Reichstag, making it the second-largest party in the country.[96] "", 'In late 1930 Goebbels met Magda Quandt, a divorcée who had joined the party a few months earlier. She worked as a volunteer in the party offices in Berlin, helping Goebbels organise his private papers.[97] Her flat on  Reichskanzlerplatz soon became a favourite meeting place for Hitler and other Nazi Party officials.[98] Goebbels and Quandt married on 19 December 1931[99] at a Protestant church.[100] Hitler was his best man.[98]', 'For two further elections held in 1932, Goebbels organised massive campaigns that included rallies, parades, speeches, and Hitler travelling around the country by aeroplane with the slogan ""the Führer over Germany"".[101] Goebbels wrote in his diary that the Nazis must gain power and exterminate Marxism.[102] He undertook numerous speaking tours during these election campaigns and had some of their speeches published on gramophone records and as pamphlets. Goebbels was also involved in the production of a small collection of silent films that could be shown at party meetings, though they did not yet have enough equipment to widely use this medium.[103][104] Many of Goebbels\' campaign posters used violent imagery such as a giant half-clad male destroying political opponents or other perceived enemies such as ""International High Finance"".[105] His propaganda characterised the opposition as ""November criminals"", ""Jewish wire-pullers"", or a communist threat.[106]', 'Support for the party continued to grow, but neither of these elections led to a majority government. In an effort to stabilise the country and improve economic conditions, Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Reich chancellor on 30 January 1933.[107]', ""To celebrate Hitler's appointment as chancellor, Goebbels organised a torchlight parade in Berlin on the night of 30 January of an estimated 60,000 men, many in the uniforms of the SA and SS. The spectacle was covered by a live state radio broadcast, with commentary by longtime party member and future Minister of Aviation Hermann Göring.[108] Goebbels was disappointed not to be given a post in Hitler's new cabinet. Bernhard Rust was appointed as Minister of Culture, the post that Goebbels was expecting to receive.[109] Like other Nazi Party officials, Goebbels had to deal with Hitler's leadership style of giving contradictory orders to his subordinates, while placing them into positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped.[110] In this way, Hitler fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power.[111] The Nazi Party took advantage of the Reichstag fire of 27 February 1933, with Hindenburg passing the Reichstag Fire Decree the following day at Hitler's urging. This was the first of several pieces of legislation that dismantled democracy in Germany and put a totalitarian dictatorship—headed by Hitler—in its place.[112] On 5 March, yet another Reichstag election took place, the last to be held before the defeat of the Nazis at the end of the Second World War.[113] While the Nazi Party increased their number of seats and percentage of the vote, it was not the landslide expected by the party leadership.[114] Goebbels finally received Hitler's appointment to the cabinet, officially becoming head of the newly created Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda on 14 March.[115]"", ""The role of the new ministry, which set up its offices in the 18th-century Ordenspalais across from the Reich Chancellery, was to centralise Nazi control of all aspects of German cultural and intellectual life.[116] Goebbels hoped to increase popular support of the party from the 37 per cent achieved at the last free election held in Germany on 25 March 1933 to 100 per cent support. An unstated goal was to present to other nations the impression that the Nazi Party had the full and enthusiastic backing of the entire population.[117] One of Goebbels' first productions was staging the Day of Potsdam, a ceremonial passing of power from Hindenburg to Hitler, held in Potsdam on 21 March.[118] He composed the text of Hitler's decree authorising the Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses, held on 1 April.[119] Later that month, Goebbels travelled back to Rheydt, where he was given a triumphal reception. The townsfolk lined the main street, which had been renamed in his honour. On the following day, Goebbels was declared a local hero.[120]"", 'Goebbels converted the 1 May holiday from a celebration of workers\' rights (observed as such especially by the communists) into a day celebrating the Nazi Party. In place of the usual ad hoc labour celebrations, he organised a huge party rally held at Tempelhof Field in Berlin. The following day, all trade union offices in the country were forcibly disbanded by the SA and SS, and the Nazi-run German Labour Front was created to take their place.[121] ""We are the masters of Germany,"" he commented in his diary entry of 3 May.[122] Less than two weeks later, he gave a speech at the Nazi book burning in Berlin on 10 May,[123] a ceremony he suggested.[67]', 'Meanwhile, the Nazi Party began passing laws to marginalise Jews and remove them from German society. The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, passed on 7 April 1933, forced all non-Aryans to retire from the legal profession and civil service.[124] Similar legislation soon deprived Jewish members of other professions of their right to practise.[124] The first Nazi concentration camps (initially created to house political dissenters) were founded shortly after Hitler seized power.[125] In a process termed Gleichschaltung (coordination), the Nazi Party proceeded to rapidly bring all aspects of life under control of the party. All civilian organisations, including agricultural groups, volunteer organisations, and sports clubs, had their leadership replaced with Nazi sympathisers or party members. By June 1933, virtually the only organisations not in the control of the Nazi Party were the army and the churches.[126] On 2 June 1933, Hitler appointed Goebbels a Reichsleiter, the second highest political rank in the Nazi Party.[127] On 3 October 1933, on the formation of the Academy for German Law, Goebbels was made a member and given a seat on its executive committee.[128] In a move to manipulate Germany\'s middle class and shape popular opinion, the regime passed on 4 October 1933 the Schriftleitergesetz (Editor\'s Law), which became the cornerstone of the Nazi Party\'s control of the popular press.[129] Modelled to some extent on the system in Benito Mussolini\'s Fascist Italy, the law defined a Schriftleiter as anyone who wrote, edited, or selected texts and/or illustrated material for serial publication. Individuals selected for this position were chosen based on experiential, educational, and racial criteria.[130] The law required journalists to ""regulate their work in accordance with National Socialism as a philosophy of life and as a conception of government.""[131]', 'In 1934, Goebbels published Vom Kaiserhof zur Reichskanzlei (""From the Kaiserhof to the Reich Chancellery""), his account of Hitler\'s seizure of power, which he based on his diary from 1 January 1932 to 1 May 1933. The book sought to glorify both Hitler and the author.[132] It sold around 660,000 copies, making it Goebbels\'s best-selling publication during his lifetime.[133]', 'At the end of June 1934, top officials of the SA and opponents of the regime, including Gregor Strasser, were arrested and killed in a purge later called the Night of Long Knives. Goebbels was present at the arrest of SA leader Ernst Röhm in Munich.[134] On 2 August 1934, President von Hindenburg died. In a radio broadcast, Goebbels announced that the offices of president and chancellor had been combined, and Hitler had been formally named as Führer und Reichskanzler (leader and chancellor).[135]', 'The propaganda ministry was organised into seven departments: administration and legal; mass rallies, public health, youth, and race; radio; national and foreign press; films and film censorship; art, music, and theatre; and protection against counter-propaganda, both foreign and domestic.[136] Goebbels\'s style of leadership was tempestuous and unpredictable. He would suddenly change direction and shift his support between senior associates; he was a difficult boss and liked to berate his staff in public.[137] Goebbels was successful at his job, however; Life wrote in 1938 that ""[p]ersonally he likes nobody, is liked by nobody, and runs the most efficient Nazi department.""[138] John Gunther wrote in 1940 that Goebbels ""is the cleverest of all the Nazis"", but could not succeed Hitler because ""everybody hates him"".[139]', 'The Reich Film Chamber, which all members of the film industry were required to join, was created in June 1933.[140] Goebbels promoted the development of films with a Nazi slant, and ones that contained subliminal or overt propaganda messages.[141] Under the auspices of the Reichskulturkammer (Reich Chamber of Culture), created in September, Goebbels added additional sub-chambers for the fields of broadcasting, fine arts, literature, music, the press, and the theatre.[142] As in the film industry, anyone wishing to pursue a career in these fields had to be a member of the corresponding chamber. In this way anyone whose views were contrary to the regime could be excluded from working in their chosen field and thus silenced.[143] In addition, journalists (now considered employees of the state) were required to prove Aryan descent back to the year 1800, and if married, the same requirement applied to the spouse. Members of any chamber were not allowed to leave the country for their work without prior permission of their chamber. A committee was established to censor books, and works could not be re-published unless they were on the list of approved works. Similar regulations applied to other fine arts and entertainment; even cabaret performances were censored.[144] Many German artists and intellectuals left Germany in the pre-war years rather than work under these restrictions.[145]', 'Goebbels was particularly interested in controlling the radio, which was then still a fairly new mass medium.[146] Sometimes under protest from individual states (particularly Prussia, headed by Göring), Goebbels gained control of radio stations nationwide, and placed them under the Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft (German National Broadcasting Corporation) in July 1934.[147] Manufacturers were urged by Goebbels to produce inexpensive home receivers, called Volksempfänger (people\'s receiver), and by 1938 nearly ten million sets had been sold. Loudspeakers were placed in public areas, factories, and schools, so that important party broadcasts would be heard live by nearly all Germans.[146] On 2 September 1939 (the day after the start of the war), Goebbels and the Council of Ministers proclaimed it illegal to listen to foreign radio stations. Disseminating news from foreign broadcasts could result in the death penalty.[148] Albert Speer, Hitler\'s architect and later Minister for Armaments and War Production, later said the regime ""made the complete use of all technical means for domination of its own country. Through technical devices like the radio and loudspeaker, 80 million people were deprived of independent thought.""[149]', 'A major focus of Nazi propaganda was Hitler himself, who was glorified as a heroic and infallible leader and became the focus of a cult of personality.[150] Much of this was spontaneous, but some was stage-managed as part of Goebbels\' propaganda work.[151] Adulation of Hitler was the focus of the 1934 Nuremberg Rally, where his moves were carefully choreographed. The rally was the subject of the film Triumph of the Will, one of several Nazi propaganda films directed by Leni Riefenstahl. It won the gold medal at the 1935 Venice Film Festival.[152] At the 1935 Nazi party congress rally at Nuremberg, Goebbels declared that ""Bolshevism is the declaration of war by Jewish-led international subhumans against culture itself.""[153]', 'Goebbels was involved in planning the staging of the 1936 Summer Olympics, held in Berlin. It was around this time that he met and started having an affair with the actress Lída Baarová, whom he continued to see until 1938.[154] A major project in 1937 was the Degenerate Art Exhibition, organised by Goebbels, which ran in Munich from July to November. The exhibition proved wildly popular, attracting over two million visitors.[155] A degenerate music exhibition took place the following year.[156] Meanwhile, Goebbels was disappointed by the lack of quality in the National Socialist artwork, films, and literature.[157]', 'In 1933, Hitler signed the Reichskonkordat (Reich Concordat), a treaty with the Vatican that required the regime to honour the independence of Catholic institutions and prohibited clergy from involvement in politics.[158] However, the regime continued to target the Christian churches to weaken their influence. Throughout 1935 and 1936, hundreds of clergy and nuns were arrested, often on trumped up charges of currency smuggling or sexual offences.[159][160] Goebbels widely publicised the trials in his propaganda campaigns, showing the cases in the worst possible light.[159] Restrictions were placed on public meetings, and Catholic publications faced censorship. Catholic schools were required to reduce religious instruction and crucifixes were removed from state buildings.[161][b] Hitler often vacillated on whether or not the Kirchenkampf (church struggle) should be a priority, but his frequent inflammatory comments on the issue were enough to convince Goebbels to intensify his work on the issue;[162] in February 1937 he stated he wanted to eliminate the Protestant church.[163]', 'In response to the persecution, Pope Pius XI had the ""Mit brennender Sorge"" (""With Burning Concern"") Encyclical smuggled into Germany for Passion Sunday 1937 and read from every pulpit. It denounced the systematic hostility of the regime toward the church.[164][165] In response, Goebbels renewed the regime\'s crackdown and propaganda against Catholics.[166] His speech of 28 May in Berlin in front of 20,000 party members, which was also broadcast on the radio, attacked the Catholic church as morally corrupt. As a result of the propaganda campaign, enrolment in denominational schools dropped sharply, and by 1939 all such schools were disbanded or converted to public facilities. Harassment and threats of imprisonment led the clergy to be much more cautious in their criticism of the regime.[167] Partly out of foreign policy concerns, Hitler ordered a scaling back of the church struggle by the end of July 1937.[168]', 'Goebbels was antisemitic from a young age.[169] After joining the Nazi Party and meeting Hitler, his antisemitism grew and became more radical. He began to see the Jews as a destructive force with a negative impact on German society.[170] In 1930, he criticised Italian Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini for his relative lack of hostility towards Jews, stating that ""Mussolini appears to have not recognized the Jewish question.""[171] After the Nazis seized control, he repeatedly urged Hitler to take action against the Jews.[172] Despite his extreme antisemitism, Goebbels spoke of the ""rubbish of race-materialism"" and of the unnecessity of biological racism for the Nazi ideology.[173] He also described Himmler\'s ideology as ""in many regards, mad"" and thought Alfred Rosenberg\'s racial theories were ridiculous.[173]', ""The Nazi Party's goal was to remove Jews from German cultural and economic life, and eventually to remove them from the country altogether.[174] In addition to his propaganda efforts, Goebbels actively promoted the persecution of the Jews through pogroms, legislation, and other actions.[175] Discriminatory measures he instituted in Berlin in the early years of the regime included bans against their using public transport and requiring that Jewish shops be marked as such.[176]"", 'In November 1938, the German diplomat Ernst vom Rath was killed in Paris by the young Jewish man Herschel Grynszpan. In response, Goebbels arranged for inflammatory antisemitic material to be released by the press, and the result was the start of a pogrom. Jews were attacked and synagogues destroyed all over Germany. The situation was further inflamed by a speech Goebbels gave at a party meeting on the night of 8 November, where he obliquely called for party members to incite further violence against Jews while making it appear to be a spontaneous series of acts by the German people. At least a hundred Jews were killed, several hundred synagogues were damaged or destroyed, and thousands of Jewish shops were vandalised in an event called Kristallnacht (Night of Broken Glass). Around 30,000 Jewish men were sent to concentration camps.[177] The destruction stopped after a conference held on 12 November, where Göring pointed out that the destruction of Jewish property was in effect the destruction of German property since the intention was that it would all eventually be confiscated.[178]', ""Goebbels continued his intensive antisemitic propaganda campaign that culminated in Hitler's 30 January 1939 Reichstag speech, which Goebbels helped to write:[179]"", 'If international finance Jewry in and outside Europe should succeed in plunging the nations once more into a world war, then the result will not be the Bolshevization of the earth and thereby the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe![180] ', 'While Goebbels had been pressing for expulsion of the Berlin Jews since 1935, there were still 62,000 living in the city in 1940. Part of the delay in their deportation was that they were needed as workers in the armaments industry.[181] Deportations of German Jews began in October 1941, with the first transport from Berlin leaving on 18 October. Some Jews were shot immediately on arrival in destinations such as Riga and Kaunas.[182] In preparation for the deportations, Goebbels ordered that all German Jews wear an identifying yellow badge as of 5 September 1941.[183] On 6 March 1942, Goebbels received a copy of the minutes of the Wannsee Conference,[184] which indicated indirectly that the Jewish population of Europe was to be sent to extermination camps in occupied areas of Poland and killed.[185] His diary entries of the period show that he was well aware of the fate of the Jews. ""In general, it can probably be established that 60 per cent of them will have to be liquidated, while only 40 per cent can be put to work.\xa0... A judgment is being carried out on the Jews which is barbaric but thoroughly deserved,"" he wrote on 27 March 1942.[186]', 'Goebbels had frequent discussions with Hitler about the fate of the Jews, a subject they discussed almost every time they met.[187] He was aware throughout that the Jews were being exterminated, and completely supported this decision. He was one of the few top Nazi officials to do so publicly.[188]', 'As early as February 1933, Hitler announced that rearmament must be undertaken, albeit clandestinely at first, as to do so was in violation of the Versailles Treaty. A year later he told his military leaders that 1942 was the target date for going to war in the east.[189] Goebbels was one of the most enthusiastic supporters of Hitler aggressively pursuing Germany\'s expansionist policies sooner rather than later. At the time of the Reoccupation of the Rhineland in 1936, Goebbels summed up his general attitude in his diary: ""[N]ow is the time for action. Fortune favors the brave! He who dares nothing wins nothing.""[190] In the lead-up to the Sudetenland crisis in 1938, Goebbels took the initiative time and again to use propaganda to whip up sympathy for the Sudeten Germans while campaigning against the Czech government.[191] Still, Goebbels was well aware there was a growing ""war panic"" in Germany and so by July had the press conduct propaganda efforts at a lower level of intensity.[192] After the Western powers acceded to Hitler\'s demands concerning Czechoslovakia in 1938, Goebbels soon redirected his propaganda machine against Poland. From May onwards, he orchestrated a campaign against Poland, fabricating stories about atrocities against ethnic Germans in Danzig and other cities. Even so, he was unable to persuade the majority of Germans to welcome the prospect of war.[193] He privately held doubts about the wisdom of risking a protracted war against Britain and France by attacking Poland.[194]', ""After the Invasion of Poland in September 1939, Goebbels used his propaganda ministry and the Reich chambers to control access to information domestically. To his chagrin, his rival Joachim von Ribbentrop, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, continually challenged Goebbels' jurisdiction over the dissemination of international propaganda. Hitler declined to make a firm ruling on the subject, so the two men remained rivals for the remainder of the Nazi era.[195] Goebbels did not participate in the military decision-making process, nor was he made privy to diplomatic negotiations until after the fact.[196]"", 'The Propaganda Ministry took over the broadcasting facilities of conquered countries immediately after surrender, and began broadcasting prepared material using the existing announcers as a way to gain the trust of the citizens.[197] Most aspects of the media, both domestically and in the conquered countries, were controlled by Goebbels and his department.[198][c] The German Home Service, the Armed Forces Programme, and the German European Service were all rigorously controlled in everything from the information they were permitted to disseminate to the music they were allowed to play.[199] Party rallies, speeches, and demonstrations continued; speeches were broadcast on the radio and short propaganda films were exhibited using 1,500 mobile film vans.[200] Hitler made fewer public appearances and broadcasts as the war progressed, so Goebbels increasingly became the voice of the Nazi regime for the German people.[199] From May 1940 he wrote frequent editorials that were published in Das Reich which were later read aloud over the radio.[201] He found films to be his most effective propaganda medium, after radio.[202] At his insistence, initially half the films made in wartime Germany were propaganda films (particularly on antisemitism) and war propaganda films (recounting both historical wars and current exploits of the Wehrmacht).[203]', 'Goebbels became preoccupied with morale and the efforts of the people on the home front. He believed that the more the people at home were involved in the war effort, the better their morale would be.[204] For example, he initiated a programme for the collection of winter clothing and ski equipment for troops on the eastern front.[204] At the same time, Goebbels implemented changes to have more ""entertaining material"" in radio and film produced for the public, decreeing in late 1942 that 20 per cent of the films should be propaganda and 80 per cent light entertainment.[205] As Gauleiter of Berlin, Goebbels dealt with increasingly serious shortages of necessities such as food and clothing, as well as the need to ration beer and tobacco, which were important for morale. Hitler suggested watering the beer and degrading the quality of the cigarettes so that more could be produced, but Goebbels refused, saying the cigarettes were already of such low quality that it was impossible to make them any worse.[206] Through his propaganda campaigns, he worked hard to maintain an appropriate level of morale among the public about the military situation, neither too optimistic nor too grim.[207] The series of military setbacks the Germans suffered in this period – the thousand-bomber raid on Cologne (May 1942), the Allied victory at the Second Battle of El Alamein (November 1942), and especially the catastrophic defeat at the Battle of Stalingrad (February 1943) – were difficult matters to present to the German public, who were increasingly weary of the war and sceptical that it could be won.[208] On 16 November 1942 Goebbels, like all Gauleiters, was appointed the Reich Defense Commissioner for his Gau. This enabled him to issue direct instructions to authorities within his jurisdiction in matters concerning the civilian war effort.[209] On 15 January 1943, Hitler appointed Goebbels as head of the newly created Air Raid Damage committee, which meant Goebbels was nominally in charge of nationwide civil air defences and shelters as well as the assessment and repair of damaged buildings.[210] In actuality, the defence of areas other than Berlin remained in the hands of the local Gauleiters, and his main tasks were limited to providing immediate aid to the affected civilians and using propaganda to improve their morale.[211][212]', ""By early 1943, the war produced a labour crisis for the regime. Hitler created a three-man committee with representatives of the State, the army, and the party in an attempt to centralise control of the war economy. The committee members were Hans Lammers (head of the Reich Chancellery), Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, chief of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Armed Forces High Command; OKW), and Martin Bormann, who controlled the party. The committee was intended to independently propose measures regardless of the wishes of various ministries, with Hitler reserving most final decisions to himself. The committee, soon known as the Dreierausschuß (Committee of Three), met eleven times between January and August 1943. However, they ran up against resistance from Hitler's cabinet ministers, who headed deeply entrenched spheres of influence and were excluded from the committee. Seeing it as a threat to their power, Goebbels, Göring, and Speer worked together to bring it down. The result was that nothing changed, and the Committee of Three declined into irrelevance by September 1943.[213]"", 'Partly in response to being excluded from the Committee of Three, Goebbels pressured Hitler to introduce measures that would produce ""total war"", including closing businesses not essential to the war effort, conscripting women into the labour force, and enlisting men in previously exempt occupations into the Wehrmacht.[214] Some of these measures were implemented in an edict of 13 January, but to Goebbels\' dismay, Göring demanded that his favourite restaurants in Berlin should remain open, and Lammers successfully lobbied Hitler to have women with children exempted from conscription, even if they had child care available.[215] After receiving an enthusiastic response to his speech of 30 January 1943 on the topic, Goebbels believed he had the support of the German people in his call for total war.[216] His next speech, the Sportpalast speech of 18 February 1943, was a passionate demand for his audience to commit to total war, which he presented as the only way to stop the Bolshevik onslaught and save the German people from destruction. The speech also had a strong antisemitic element and hinted at the extermination of the Jewish people that was already underway.[217] The speech was presented live on radio and was filmed as well.[218] During the live version of the speech, Goebbels accidentally begins to mention the ""extermination"" of the Jews; this is omitted in the published text of the speech.[219]', ""Goebbels' efforts had little impact for the time being, because Hitler, who in principle was in favour of total war, was not prepared to implement changes over the objections of his ministers.[220] The discovery around this time of a mass grave of Polish officers that had been killed by the Red Army in the 1940 Katyn massacre was made use of by Goebbels in his propaganda in an attempt to drive a wedge between the Soviets and the other Western Allies.[221]"", 'After the Allied invasion of Sicily (July 1943) and the strategic Soviet victory in the Battle of Kursk (July–August 1943), Goebbels began to recognise that the war could no longer be won.[222] Following the Allied invasion of Italy and the fall of Mussolini in September, he raised with Hitler the possibility of a separate peace, either with the Soviets or with Britain. Hitler rejected both of these proposals.[223]', ""As Germany's military and economic situation grew steadily worse, on 25 August 1943 Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler took over the post of interior minister, replacing Wilhelm Frick.[224] Intensive air raids on Berlin and other cities took the lives of thousands of people.[225] In December 1943, Hitler asked Goebbels to take on the job of Stadtpräsident (City President) of Berlin, and Goebbels agreed to this as a means of obtaining more direct control over the municipal authorities, though Hitler delayed the formal appointment for several months.[226] Goebbels took over direct administrative control of the city when he was formally named Stadtpräsident on 7 April 1944, thus uniting under his control the city's most powerful party and governmental offices.[227] As air raids on Berlin continued, Göring's Luftwaffe attempted to retaliate with air raids on London in early 1944, but they no longer had sufficient aircraft to make much of an impact.[228] While Goebbels' propaganda in this period indicated that a huge retaliation was in the offing, the V-1 flying bombs, launched on British targets beginning in mid-June 1944, had little effect, with only around 20 per cent reaching their intended targets.[229] To boost morale, Goebbels continued to publish propaganda to the effect that further improvements to these weapons would have a decisive impact on the outcome of the war.[230] Meanwhile, in the Normandy landings of 6 June 1944, the Allies successfully gained a foothold in France.[231]"", 'Throughout July 1944, Goebbels and Speer continued to press Hitler to bring the economy to a total war footing.[232] The 20 July plot, where Hitler was almost killed by a bomb at his field headquarters in East Prussia, played into the hands of those who had been pushing for change: Bormann, Goebbels, Himmler, and Speer. Over the objections of Göring, Goebbels was appointed on 23 July as Reich Plenipotentiary for Total War, charged with maximising the manpower for the Wehrmacht and the armaments industry at the expense of sectors of the economy not critical to the war effort.[233] Through these efforts, he was able to free up an additional half a million men for military service.[234] However, as many of these new recruits came from the armaments industry, the move put him in conflict with armaments minister Speer.[235] Untrained workers from elsewhere were not readily absorbed into the armaments industry, and likewise, the new Wehrmacht recruits waited in barracks for their turn to be trained.[236]', ""Hitler ordered a nationwide militia of men previously considered unsuitable for military service — the Volkssturm (People's Storm) — to be formed on 25 September 1944; it was launched on 18 October.[237] In his capacity as Gauleiter and Reich Defense Commissioner, Goebbels was named Führer des Deutschen Volkssturms im Gau Groß-Berlin on 25 September 1944, and he administered the oath of allegiance to the assembled Berlin Volkssturm troops on 12 November.[238] Goebbels recorded in his diary that 100,000 recruits were sworn in from his Gau alone. However, the men, mostly age 45 to 60, received only rudimentary training and many were not properly armed. Goebbels' notion that these men could effectively serve on the front lines against Soviet tanks and artillery was unrealistic at best. The programme was deeply unpopular.[239][240]"", 'Goebbels realised that his influence would diminish in wartime. He suffered a series of setbacks as propaganda became less important compared to warfare, the war economy, and the Allied bombing of German cities. Historian Michael Balfour states that from 1942 onward, Goebbels, ""lost control over Nazi policy toward the press and over the handling of news in general.""[241] Rival agencies expanded. The foreign ministry took charge of propaganda outside Germany. The military set up its own propaganda division, providing daily reports on the progress of the war and the conditions of the armed forces. The Nazi Party also generated and distributed its own propaganda during the war. Goebbels was still influential when he had the opportunity to meet with Hitler, who became less available as he moved his headquarters closer to the military front lines. They were together perhaps one day a month. Furthermore, Hitler rarely gave speeches or rallies of the sort that had dominated propaganda in the 1930s. After Hitler returned to Berlin in 1945, Goebbels\' ministry was destroyed by an Allied air raid on 13 March, and Goebbels had great difficulty disseminating propaganda. In April 1945, he finally bested the rival agencies and took full charge of propaganda, but by then the Soviet Red Army had already entered Berlin. Goebbels was an astute observer of the war, and historians have exhaustively mined his diary for insights on how the Nazi leadership tried to maintain public morale.[242][243][244]', ""In the last months of the war, Goebbels' speeches and articles took on an increasingly apocalyptic tone.[245] By the beginning of 1945, with the Soviets on the Oder River and the Western Allies preparing to cross the Rhine River, he could no longer disguise the inevitability of German defeat.[246] Berlin had little in the way of fortifications or artillery, and even Volkssturm units were in short supply, as almost everything and everyone had been sent to the front.[247] Goebbels noted in his diary on 21 January that millions of Germans were fleeing westward.[248] He tentatively discussed with Hitler the issue of making peace overtures to the Western Allies, but Hitler again refused. Privately, Goebbels was conflicted at pushing the case with Hitler since he did not want to lose Hitler's confidence.[249]"", 'When other Nazi leaders urged Hitler to leave Berlin and establish a new centre of resistance in the National Redoubt in Bavaria, Goebbels opposed this, arguing for a heroic last stand in Berlin.[250] His family (except for Magda\'s son Harald, who had served in the Luftwaffe and been captured by the Allies) moved into their house in Berlin to await the end.[247] He and Magda may have discussed suicide and the fate of their young children in a long meeting on the night of 27 January.[251] He knew how the outside world would view the criminal acts committed by the regime and had no desire to subject himself to the ""debacle"" of a trial.[252] He burned his private papers on the night of 18 April.[253]', 'Goebbels knew how to play on Hitler\'s fantasies, encouraging him to see the hand of providence in the death of United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt on 12 April.[254] Whether Hitler really saw this event as a turning point as Goebbels proclaimed is not known.[255] By this time, Goebbels had gained the position he had wanted so long—at Hitler\'s side. Göring was utterly discredited, although he was not stripped of his offices until 23 April.[256] Himmler, whose appointment as commander of Army Group Vistula had led to disaster on the Oder, was also in disgrace with Hitler.[257] Most of Hitler\'s inner circle, including Göring, Himmler, Ribbentrop, and Speer, prepared to leave Berlin immediately after Hitler\'s birthday celebration on 20 April.[258] Even Bormann was ""not anxious"" to meet his end at Hitler\'s side.[259] On 22 April, Hitler announced that he would stay in Berlin until the end and then shoot himself.[260] Goebbels moved with his family into the Vorbunker, connected to the lower Führerbunker under the Reich Chancellery garden in central Berlin, that same day.[261] He told Vice-Admiral Hans-Erich Voss that he would not entertain the idea of either surrender or escape.[262] On 23 April, Goebbels made the following proclamation to the people of Berlin:', 'I call on you to fight for your city. Fight with everything you have got, for the sake of your wives and your children, your mothers and your parents. Your arms are defending everything we have ever held dear, and all the generations that will come after us. Be proud and courageous! Be inventive and cunning! Your Gauleiter is amongst you. He and his colleagues will remain in your midst. His wife and children are here as well. He, who once captured the city with 200 men, will now use every means to galvanize the defence of the capital. The battle for Berlin must become the signal for the whole nation to rise up in battle.[263] ', 'After midnight on 29 April, with the Soviets advancing ever closer to the bunker complex, Hitler married Eva Braun in a small civil ceremony in the Führerbunker.[264][d] Afterward, he hosted a modest wedding breakfast.[265] Hitler then took secretary Traudl Junge to another room and dictated his last will and testament.[266][d] Goebbels and Bormann were two of the witnesses.[267]', 'In his last will and testament, Hitler named no successor as Führer or leader of the Nazi Party. Instead, he appointed Goebbels as Reich Chancellor; Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz, who was at Flensburg near the Danish border, as Reich President; and Bormann as Party Minister.[268] Goebbels wrote a postscript to the will stating that he would ""categorically refuse"" to obey Hitler\'s order to leave Berlin—as he put it, ""the first time in my life"" that he had not complied with Hitler\'s orders.[269] He felt compelled to remain with Hitler ""for reasons of humanity and personal loyalty"".[270] His wife and children would stay as well. They would end their lives ""side by side with the Führer"".[270]', 'In the mid-afternoon of 30 April, Hitler shot himself.[271] Goebbels was depressed, and said he would walk around the Chancellery garden until he was killed by the Russian shelling.[272] Voss later recounted Goebbels as saying: ""It is a great pity that such a man [Hitler] is not with us any longer. But there is nothing to be done. For us, everything is lost now and the only way out left for us is the one Hitler chose. I shall follow his example.""[273]', ""On 1 May, Goebbels carried out his sole official act as Chancellor: he dictated a letter to General Vasily Chuikov and ordered German General Hans Krebs to deliver it under a white flag. Chuikov, as commander of the Soviet 8th Guards Army, commanded the Soviet forces in central Berlin. Goebbels' letter informed Chuikov of Hitler's death and requested a ceasefire. After this was rejected, Goebbels decided that further efforts were futile.[274]"", 'Later on 1 May, Voss saw Goebbels for the last time: ""While saying goodbye I asked Goebbels to join us. But he replied: \'The captain must not leave his sinking ship. I have thought about it all and decided to stay here. I have nowhere to go because with little children I will not be able to make it, especially with a leg like mine\'.""[275] On the evening of 1 May, Goebbels arranged for an SS dentist, Helmut Kunz, to inject his six children with morphine so that when they were unconscious, an ampule of a cyanide compound could be then crushed in each of their mouths.[276] According to Kunz\'s later testimony, he gave the children morphine injections but Magda Goebbels and SS-Obersturmbannführer Ludwig Stumpfegger, Hitler\'s personal doctor, administered the cyanide.[276]', ""At around 20:30, Goebbels and Magda left the bunker and walked up to the garden of the Chancellery, where they killed themselves.[277] There are several different accounts of this event. One is that they each bit on a cyanide ampule near where Hitler had been buried and were given a coup de grâce immediately afterward.[278] Goebbels' SS adjutant Günther Schwägermann testified in 1948 that they walked ahead of him up the stairs and out into the Chancellery garden. He waited in the stairwell and heard shots. Schwägermann then walked up the remaining stairs and, once outside, saw their lifeless bodies. Following Goebbels' prior order, Schwägermann had an SS soldier fire several shots into Goebbels' body, which did not move.[277] In a contradictory account, SS-Oberscharführer Rochus Misch claimed that mechanic Johannes Hentschel told him that early on 2 May, Goebbels killed himself in his room in the Führerbunker, while Magda did so in the Vorbunker.[279]"", ""The corpses were then doused with petrol, but they were only partially burned and not buried.[278] A few days later, the Soviets brought Voss back to the bunker to identify the Goebbels' partly burned bodies. The remains of the Goebbels family, Krebs, and Hitler's dogs were repeatedly buried and exhumed.[280][281] The last burial was at the SMERSH facility in Magdeburg on 21 February 1946. In 1970, KGB director Yuri Andropov authorised an operation to destroy the remains.[282] On 4 April 1970, a Soviet KGB team used detailed burial charts to exhume five wooden boxes at the Magdeburg SMERSH facility. They were burned, crushed, and scattered into the Biederitz river, a tributary of the nearby Elbe.[283]"", ""Hitler was very fond of Magda and the children.[285] He enjoyed staying at the Goebbels' Berlin apartment, where he could relax.[286] Magda had a close relationship with Hitler, and became a member of his small coterie of female friends.[98] She also became an unofficial representative of the regime, receiving letters from all over Germany from women with questions about domestic matters or child custody issues.[287]"", 'In 1936, Goebbels met the Czech actress Lída Baarová and by the winter of 1937 began an intense affair with her.[288] Magda had a long conversation with Hitler about it on 15 August 1938.[289] Unwilling to put up with a scandal involving one of his top ministers, Hitler demanded that Goebbels break off the relationship.[290] Thereafter, Joseph and Magda seemed to reach a truce until the end of September.[289] The couple had another falling out at that point, and again Hitler became involved, insisting the couple stay together.[291] He arranged for publicity photos to be taken of himself with the reconciled couple in October.[292] Goebbels also had short-term affairs and relationships with numerous other women.[293] Magda too had affairs, including a relationship with Kurt Lüdecke in 1933[294] and Karl Hanke in 1938.[295]', ""The Goebbels family included Harald Quandt (Magda's son from her first marriage; b. 1921),[296] plus Helga (b. 1932), Hilde (b. 1934), Helmut (b. 1935), Holde (b. 1937), Hedda (b. 1938), and Heide (b. 1940).[297] Harald was the only member of the family to survive the war.[298] He died in an aeroplane crash in 1967.[299]"", 'Final solution']","Paul Joseph Goebbels (German: [ˈpaʊ̯l ˈjoːzɛf ˈɡœbl̩s] ⓘ; 29 October 1897 – 1 May 1945) was a German Nazi politician and philologist who was the Gauleiter (district leader) of Berlin, chief propagandist for the Nazi Party, and then Reich Minister of Propaganda from 1933 to 1945. He was one of Adolf Hitler's closest and most devoted followers, known for his skills in public speaking and his deeply virulent antisemitism which was evident in his publicly voiced views. He advocated progressively harsher discrimination, including the extermination of the Jews in the Holocaust.","Here is a summary of the article about Joseph Goebbels' last days:

Philippe_Pétain,"['Henri Philippe Bénoni Omer Joseph Pétain (24 April 1856 – 23 July 1951), better known as Philippe Pétain (French: [filip petɛ̃]) and Marshal Pétain (French: Maréchal Pétain), was a French general who commanded the French Army in World War I and later became the head of the collaborationist regime of Vichy France, from 1940 to 1944, during World War II.', 'Pétain was admitted to the Saint-Cyr Military Academy in 1876 and pursued a career in the military, achieving the rank of colonel by the outbreak of World War I. He led the French Army to victory at the nine-month-long Battle of Verdun, for which he was called ""the Lion of Verdun"" (French: le lion de Verdun). After the failed Nivelle Offensive and subsequent mutinies, he was appointed Commander-in-Chief and succeeded in restoring control. Pétain remained in command for the rest of the war and emerged as a national hero. During the interwar period, he was head of the peacetime French Army, commanded joint Franco-Spanish operations during the Rif War and served twice as a government minister. During this time he was known as le vieux Maréchal (""the Old Marshal"").', ""On 16 June 1940, with the imminent Fall of France and the government desire for an armistice, Prime Minister Paul Reynaud resigned, recommending to President Albert Lebrun that he appoint Pétain in his place, which he did that day, while the government was at Bordeaux. The government then resolved to sign armistice agreements with Germany and Italy. The entire government subsequently moved briefly to Clermont-Ferrand, then to the town of Vichy in central France. It voted to transform the French Third Republic into the French State, better known as Vichy France, an authoritarian puppet regime that was allowed to govern the southeast of France and which collaborated with the Axis powers. After Germany and Italy occupied all of France in November 1942, Pétain's government worked closely with the Nazi German military administration."", 'After the war, Pétain was tried and convicted for treason. He was originally sentenced to death, but due to his age and World War I service his sentence was commuted to life in prison. His journey from military obscurity, to hero of France during World War I, to collaborationist ruler during World War II, led his successor Charles de Gaulle to declare that Pétain\'s life was ""successively banal, then glorious, then deplorable, but never mediocre"".', 'Pétain, who was 84 years old when he became Prime Minister and later Chief of State, remains both the oldest person to become the head of government and the oldest person to become the head of state of France.', 'Pétain was born into a peasant family in Cauchy-à-la-Tour, in the Pas-de-Calais department, northern France, on 24 April 1856.[1][page\xa0needed][2] He was one of five children of Omer-Venant Pétain (1816–1888), a farmer, and Clotilde Legrand (1824–1857), and was their only son.[1][page\xa0needed] His father had previously lived in Paris, where he worked for photography pioneer Louis Daguerre, before returning to the family farm in Cauchy-à-la-Tour following the Revolution of 1848.[1][page\xa0needed] One of his great-uncles, a Catholic priest, Father Abbe Lefebvre (1771–1866), served in the Grande Armée during the Napoleonic Wars.[1][page\xa0needed]', ""Pétain's mother died when he was 18 months old, and he was raised by relatives after his father remarried.[1][page\xa0needed] He attended the Catholic boarding school of Saint-Bertin in the nearby town of Saint-Omer, where he was an excellent student, showing an aptitude for geography and arithmetic.[3] In 1875, with the intention of preparing for the Saint-Cyr Military Academy, Pétain enrolled in the Dominican college of Albert-le-Grand in Arcueil.[1][page\xa0needed]"", 'Pétain was admitted to Saint-Cyr in 1876, beginning his career in the French Army. Between graduating in 1878 and 1899, he served in various garrisons with different battalions of the chasseurs,[1][page\xa0needed] the elite light infantry of the French Army. Thereafter, he alternated between staff and regimental assignments.', 'Pétain\'s career progressed slowly, as he rejected the French Army philosophy of the furious infantry assault, arguing instead that ""firepower kills"". His views were later proved to be correct during the First World War. He was promoted to captain in 1890 and major (chef de bataillon) in 1900. In March 1904, by then serving in the 104th Infantry, he was appointed adjunct professor of applied infantry tactics at the École Supérieure de Guerre,[4] and following promotion to lieutenant-colonel was promoted to professor on 3 April 1908.[5] He was brevetted to colonel on 1 January 1910.[6]', 'Unlike many French officers, Pétain served mainly in mainland France, never French Indochina or any of the African colonies, although he participated in the Rif campaign in Morocco. As colonel, he was given command of the 33rd Infantry Regiment at Arras on 25 June 1911;[7] a young lieutenant, Charles de Gaulle, who served under him, later wrote that his ""first colonel, Pétain, taught (him) the Art of Command"". In the spring of 1914, he was given command of a brigade (still with the rank of colonel). By then aged 58 and having been told he would never become a general, Pétain had bought a villa for retirement.[8]', 'Pétain led his brigade at the Battle of Guise (29 August 1914). The following day, he was promoted to brigade general to replace brigade general Pierre Peslin\xa0[fr], who had taken his own life.[9] He was given command of the 6th Division in time for the First Battle of the Marne; little over a month later, in October 1914, he was promoted yet again and became XXXIII Corps commander. After leading his corps in the spring 1915 Artois Offensive, in July 1915 he was given command of the Second Army, which he led in the Champagne Offensive that autumn. He acquired a reputation as one of the more successful commanders on the Western Front.', 'Pétain commanded the Second Army at the start of the Battle of Verdun in February 1916. During the battle, he was promoted to Commander of Army Group Centre, which contained a total of 52 divisions. Rather than holding down the same infantry divisions on the Verdun battlefield for months, akin to the German system, he rotated them out after only two weeks on the front lines. His decision to organise truck transport over the ""Voie Sacrée"" to bring a continuous stream of artillery, ammunition, and fresh troops into besieged Verdun also played a key role in grinding down the German onslaught to a final halt in July 1916. In effect, he applied the basic principle that was a mainstay of his teachings at the École de Guerre (War College) before World War I: ""le feu tue!"" or ""firepower kills!""\xa0– in this case meaning French field artillery, which fired over 15 million shells on the Germans during the first five months of the battle. Although Pétain did say ""On les aura!"" (an echoing of Joan of Arc, roughly: ""We\'ll get them!""), the other famous quotation often attributed to him – ""Ils ne passeront pas!"" (""They shall not pass""!) – was actually uttered by Robert Nivelle who succeeded him in command of the Second Army at Verdun in May 1916. At the very end of 1916, Nivelle was promoted over Pétain to replace Joseph Joffre as French Commander-in-Chief.', ""Because of his high prestige as a soldier's soldier, Pétain served briefly as Army Chief of Staff (from the end of April 1917). He then became Commander-in-Chief of the entire French army, replacing General Nivelle, whose Chemin des Dames offensive failed in April 1917 and thereby provoked widespread mutinies in the French Army. They involved, to various degrees, nearly half of the French infantry divisions stationed on the Western Front. Pétain restored morale by talking to the men, promising no more suicidal attacks, providing rest for exhausted units, home furloughs, and moderate discipline. He held 3400 courts martial; 554 mutineers were sentenced to death but over 90% had their sentences commuted.[10]  The mutinies were kept secret from the Germans and their full extent and intensity were not revealed until decades later. Gilbert and Bernard find multiple causes:"", 'The immediate cause was the extreme optimism and subsequent disappointment at the Nivelle offensive in the spring of 1917. Other causes were pacifism, stimulated by the Russian Revolution and the trade-union movement, and disappointment at the nonarrival of American troops.[11]', 'Pétain conducted some successful but limited offensives in the latter part of 1917, while the British carried out an offensive at Passchendaele that autumn. Pétain, instead, held off from major French offensives until the Americans arrived in force on the front lines, which did not happen until the early summer of 1918. He was also waiting for the new Renault FT tanks to be introduced in large numbers, hence his statement at the time: J\'attends les chars et les Américains (""I am waiting for the tanks and the Americans."")[12]', 'The year 1918 saw major German offensives on the Western Front. The first of these, Operation Michael in March 1918, threatened to split the British and French forces apart, and, after Pétain had threatened to retreat on Paris, the Doullens Conference was called. Just prior to the main meeting, Prime Minister Clemenceau claimed he heard Pétain say ""les Allemands battront les Anglais en rase campagne, après quoi ils nous battront aussi"" (""the Germans will beat the English (sic) in open country, then they\'ll beat us as well""). He reported this conversation to President Raymond Poincaré, adding ""surely a general should not speak or think like that?"" Haig recorded that Pétain had ""a terrible look. He had the appearance of a commander who had lost his nerve"". Pétain believed – wrongly – that Gough\'s Fifth Army had been routed like the Italians at Caporetto.[13] At the Conference, Ferdinand Foch was appointed as Allied Generalissimo, initially with powers to co-ordinate and deploy Allied reserves where he saw fit. Pétain eventually came to the aid of the British and secured the front with forty French divisions.', 'Pétain proved a capable opponent of the Germans both in defence and through counter-attack. The third offensive, ""Blücher"", in May 1918, saw major German advances on the Aisne, as the French Army commander (Humbert) ignored Pétain\'s instructions to defend in depth and instead allowed his men to be hit by the initial massive German bombardment. By the time of the last German offensives, Gneisenau and the Second Battle of the Marne, Pétain was able to defend in depth and launch counter offensives, with the new French tanks and the assistance of the Americans. Later in the year, Pétain was stripped of his right of direct appeal to the French government and requested to report to Foch, who increasingly assumed the co-ordination and ultimately the command of the Allied offensives.[citation needed] On the day of the armistice, Pétain wanted to continue offensive operations into Germany to prevent another war but was overruled by Foch.[14]After the war ended Pétain was made Marshal of France on 21 November 1918.[15]', 'Pétain ended the war regarded ""without a doubt, the most accomplished defensive tactician of any army"" and ""one of France\'s greatest military heroes"" and was presented with his baton of Marshal of France at a public ceremony at Metz by President Poincaré on 8 December 1918.[16][failed verification] He was summoned to be present at the signing of the Treaty of Versailles on 28 June 1919. His job as Commander-in-Chief came to an end with peace and demobilisation, and with Foch out of favour after his quarrel with the French government over the peace terms, it was Pétain who, in January 1920, was appointed Vice-Chairman of the revived Conseil supérieur de la Guerre (Supreme War Council). This was France\'s highest military position, whose holder was Commander-in-Chief designate in the event of war and who had the right to overrule the Chief of the General Staff (a position held in the 1920s by Pétain\'s protégés Buat and Debeney), and Pétain would hold it until 1931.[17][18] Pétain was encouraged by friends to go into politics, although he protested that he had little interest in running for an elected position. He nevertheless tried and failed to get himself elected President following the November 1919 elections.[19]', 'Shortly after the war, Pétain had placed before the government plans for a large tank and air force, but ""at the meeting of the Conseil supérieur de la Défense Nationale of 12 March 1920, the Finance Minister, François-Marsal, announced that although Pétain\'s proposals were excellent they were unaffordable"". In addition, François-Marsal announced reductions – in the army from fifty-five divisions to thirty, in the air force, and did not mention tanks. It was left to the Marshals, Pétain, Joffre, and Foch, to pick up the pieces of their strategies. The General Staff, now under General Edmond Buat, began to think seriously about a line of forts along the frontier with Germany, and their report was tabled[clarification needed] on 22 May 1922.  The three Marshals supported this. The cuts in military expenditure meant that taking the offensive was now impossible and a defensive strategy was all they could have.[20]', ""Pétain was appointed Inspector-General of the Army in February 1922, and produced, in concert with the new Chief of the General Staff, General Marie-Eugène Debeney, the new army manual entitled Provisional Instruction on the Tactical Employment of Large Units, which soon became known as 'the Bible'.[21] On 3 September 1925, Pétain was appointed sole Commander-in-Chief of French Forces in Morocco[22] to launch a major campaign against the Rif tribes, in concert with the Spanish Army, which was successfully concluded by the end of October. He was subsequently decorated, at Toledo, by King Alfonso XIII with the Spanish Medalla Militar.[23]"", 'In 1924 the National Assembly was elected on a platform of reducing the length of national service to one year, to which Pétain was almost violently opposed. In January 1926, the Chief of Staff, General Debeney, proposed to the Conseil a ""totally new kind of army. Only 20 infantry divisions would be maintained on a standing basis"". Reserves could be called up when needed. The Conseil had no option in the straitened circumstances but to agree. Pétain disapproved of the whole thing, pointing out that North Africa still had to be defended and in itself required a substantial standing army. But he recognised, after the new Army Organisation Law of 1927, that the tide was flowing against him. He would not forget that the Radical leader, Édouard Daladier, even voted against the whole package, on the grounds that the Army was still too large.[24]', ""On 5 December 1925, after the Locarno Treaty, the Conseil demanded immediate action on a line of fortifications along the eastern frontier to counter the already proposed decline in manpower. A new commission for this purpose was established, under Joseph Joffre, and called for reports. In July 1927 Pétain himself went to reconnoitre the whole area. He returned with a revised plan and the commission then proposed two fortified regions. The Maginot Line, as it came to be called, (named after André Maginot the former Minister of War) thereafter occupied a good deal of Pétain's attention during 1928, when he also travelled extensively, visiting military installations up and down the country.[25] Pétain had based his strong support for the Maginot Line on his own experience of the role played by the forts during the Battle of Verdun in 1916."", 'Captain Charles de Gaulle continued to be a protégé of Pétain throughout these years. He even allegedly named his eldest son after the Marshal, although it is more likely that he named his son after his family ancestor Jean Baptiste Philippe de Gaulle,[26] before finally falling out over the authorship of a book he had said he had ghost-written for Pétain.', 'In 1928, Pétain had supported the creation of an independent air force removed from the control of the army, and on 9 February 1931, following his retirement as Vice-Chairman of the Supreme War Council, he was appointed Inspector-General of Air Defence.[27] His first report on air defence, submitted in July that year, advocated increased expenditure.[28] In 1931 Pétain was elected a Fellow of the Académie française. By 1932 the economic situation had worsened and Édouard Herriot\'s government had made ""severe cuts in the defence budget... orders for new weapons systems all but dried up"". Summer manoeuvres in 1932 and 1933 were cancelled due to lack of funds, and recruitment to the armed forces fell off. In the latter year General Maxime Weygand claimed that ""the French Army was no longer a serious fighting force"". Édouard Daladier\'s new government retaliated against Weygand by reducing the number of officers and cutting military pensions and pay, arguing that such measures, apart from financial stringency, were in the spirit of the Geneva Disarmament Conference.[29]', ""In 1938, Pétain encouraged and assisted the writer André Maurois in gaining election to the Académie française – an election which was highly contested, in part due to Maurois' Jewish origin. Maurois made a point of acknowledging with thanks his debt to Pétain in his 1941 autobiography, Call no man happy\xa0– though by the time of writing their paths had sharply diverged, Pétain having become Head of State of Vichy France while Maurois went into exile and sided with the Free French."", 'Political unease was sweeping the country and, on 6 February 1934, the Paris police fired on a group of far-right rioters outside the Chamber of Deputies, killing 14 and wounding a further 236. President Lebrun invited 71-year-old Doumergue to come out of retirement and form a new ""government of national unity"". On 8 February, Pétain was invited to join the new French cabinet as Minister of War, which he only reluctantly accepted after many representations.', 'His important success that year was in getting Daladier\'s previous proposal to reduce the number of officers repealed. He improved the recruitment programme for specialists and lengthened the training period by reducing leave entitlements. However, Weygand reported to the Senate Army Commission that year that the French Army still could not resist a German attack. Marshals Louis Franchet d\'Espèrey and Hubert Lyautey (the latter died suddenly in July) added their names to the report. After the autumn manoeuvres, which Pétain had reinstated, a report was presented to Pétain that officers had been poorly instructed, had little basic knowledge and no confidence. He was also told by Maurice Gamelin that, if the plebiscite in the Territory of the Saar Basin went for Germany, ""it would be a serious military error"" for the French Army to intervene. Pétain responded by again petitioning the government for further funds for the army.[30]', 'During this period, he repeatedly called for a lengthening of the term of compulsory military service for conscripts from two to three years, to no avail. Pétain accompanied President Lebrun to Belgrade for the funeral of King Alexander, who had been assassinated on 6 October 1934 in Marseille by Vlado Chernozemski, a Bulgarian nationalist from IMRO. Here he met Hermann Göring and the two men reminisced about their experiences in the Great War. ""When Göring returned to Germany he spoke admiringly of Pétain, describing him as a \'man of honour\'"".[31]', 'In November, the Doumergue government fell. Pétain had previously expressed interest in being named Minister of Education (as well as of War), a role in which he hoped to combat what he saw as the decay in French moral values.[32] Now, however, he refused to continue in Flandin\'s short-lived government as Minister of War and stood down – in spite of a direct appeal from Lebrun himself. At this moment an article appeared in the newspaper Le Petit Journal, calling for Pétain as a candidate for a dictatorship. 200,000 readers responded to the paper\'s poll. Pétain came first, with 47,000, ahead of Pierre Laval\'s 31,000 votes. These two men travelled to Warsaw for the funeral of the Polish Marshal Piłsudski in May 1935 (and another cordial meeting with Göring).[33] Although Le Petit Journal was conservative, Pétain\'s high reputation was bipartisan; socialist Léon Blum called him ""the most human of our military commanders"". Pétain did not get involved in non-military issues when in the Cabinet, and unlike other military leaders he did not have a reputation as an extreme Catholic or a monarchist.[34]', ""He remained on the Conseil superieur. Weygand had been at the British Army 1934 manoeuvres at Tidworth Camp in June and was appalled by what he had seen. Addressing the Conseil on the 23rd, Pétain claimed that it would be fruitless to look for assistance to the United Kingdom in the event of a German attack. On 1 March 1935, Pétain's famous article[35] appeared in the Revue des deux mondes, where he reviewed the history of the army since 1927–28. He criticised the reservist system in France, and her lack of adequate air power and armour. This article appeared just five days before Adolf Hitler's announcement of Germany's new air force and a week before the announcement that Germany was increasing its army to 36 divisions. On 26 April 1936, the general election results showed 5.5\xa0million votes for the Popular Front parties against 4.5\xa0million for the Right on an 84% turnout. On 3 May Pétain, was interviewed in Le Journal where he launched an attack on the Franco-Soviet Pact, on Communism in general (France had the largest communist party in Western Europe), and on those who allowed Communists intellectual responsibility. He said that France had lost faith in her destiny.[36] Pétain was now in his 80th year."", ""Some argue[who?] that Pétain, as France's most senior soldier after Foch's death, should bear some responsibility for the poor state of French weaponry preparation before World War II. Others say that Pétain was one of many on a large committee responsible for national defence, and interwar governments frequently cut military budgets. In addition, with the restrictions imposed on Germany by the Versailles Treaty there seemed no urgency for vast expenditure until the advent of Hitler. It is argued[who?] that while Pétain supported the massive use of tanks he saw them mostly as infantry support, leading to the fragmentation of the French tank force into many types of unequal value spread out between mechanised cavalry (such as the SOMUA S35) and infantry support (mostly the Renault R35 tanks and the Char B1 bis). Modern infantry rifles and machine guns were not manufactured, with the sole exception of a light machine-rifle, the Mle 1924. The French heavy machine gun was still the Hotchkiss M1914, obsolete when compared to the new automatic weapons of German infantry. A modern infantry rifle was adopted in 1936 but very few of these MAS-36 rifles had been issued to the troops by 1940. A well-tested French semiautomatic rifle, the MAS 1938–39, was ready for adoption but it never reached the production stage until after World War II as the MAS 49. French artillery had not been modernised since 1918. The result of all these failings is that the French Army had to face the invading enemy in 1940 with the dated weaponry of 1918. Pétain had been made Minister of War in 1934, but could not reverse 15 years of inactivity and constant cutbacks.  French aviation entered the War in 1939 without even the prototype of a bomber aeroplane capable of reaching Berlin and coming back. French industrial efforts in fighter aircraft were dispersed among several firms (Dewoitine, Morane-Saulnier and Marcel Bloch), each with its own models."", 'In March 1939, Pétain was appointed French ambassador to the newly recognized Nationalist government of Spain. Pétain had taught the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco ""many years ago at France\'s war college"" and was sent to Spain ""in the hope he would win his former pupil away from Italian and German influence.""[37] When World War II began in September, Daladier offered Pétain a position in his government, which Pétain turned down. However, after Germany invaded France, Pétain joined the new government of Paul Reynaud on 18 May 1940 as Deputy Prime Minister. Reynaud hoped that the hero of Verdun might instill a renewed spirit of resistance and patriotism in the French Army.[34] Reportedly Franco advised Pétain against leaving his diplomatic post in Madrid, to return to a collapsing France as a ""sacrifice"".[38]', 'By 26 May, the Allied lines had been shattered, and British forces had begun evacuating at Dunkirk. French commander-in-chief Maxime Weygand expressed his fury at British retreats and the unfulfilled promise of British fighter aircraft. He and Pétain regarded the military situation as hopeless. Colonel de Villelume subsequently stated before a parliamentary commission of inquiry in 1951 that Reynaud, as Premier of France, said to Pétain on that day that they must seek an armistice.[39] Weygand said that he was in favor of saving the French army and that he ""wished to avoid internal troubles and above all anarchy"". Churchill\'s man in Paris, Edward Spears, urged the French not to sign an armistice, saying that if French ports were occupied by Germany, the United Kingdom would have to bomb them. Spears reported that Pétain did not respond immediately but stood there ""perfectly erect, with no sign of panic or emotion. He did not disguise the fact that he considered the situation catastrophic. I could not detect any sign in him of broken morale, of that mental wringing of hands and incipient hysteria noticeable in others."" Pétain later remarked to Reynaud about this statement: ""your ally now threatens us.""[citation needed]', 'On 5 June, following the fall of Dunkirk, there was a Cabinet reshuffle. Reynaud brought into his War Cabinet as Undersecretary for War the newly promoted Brigadier-General de Gaulle, whose 4th Armoured Division had launched one of the few French counterattacks the previous month. Pétain was displeased at de Gaulle’s appointment.[40] By 8 June, Paris was threatened, and the government was preparing to depart, although Pétain was opposed to such a move. During a cabinet meeting that day, Reynaud argued that before asking for an armistice, France would have to get the United Kingdom permission to be relieved from their accord of March 1940 not to sign a separate cease-fire. Pétain replied that ""the interests of France come before those of the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom got us into this position, let us now try to get out of it."" [citation needed].', 'On 10 June, the government left Paris for Tours. Weygand, the Commander-in-Chief, now declared that ""the fighting had become meaningless"". He, Minister of Finance Paul Baudouin, and several other members of the government were already set on an armistice. On 11 June, Churchill flew to the Château du Muguet, at Briare, near Orléans, where he put forward first his idea of a Breton redoubt, to which Weygand replied that it was just a ""fantasy"".[41] Churchill then said the French should consider ""guerrilla warfare"". Pétain then replied that it would mean the destruction of the country. Churchill then said the French should defend Paris and reminded Pétain of how he had come to the aid of the British with forty divisions in March 1918, and repeated Clemenceau\'s words: ', 'I will fight in front of Paris, in Paris, and behind Paris. ', 'To this, Churchill subsequently reported, Pétain replied quietly, and with dignity that he had in those days, a strategic reserve of sixty divisions; now, there were none, and the British ought to be providing divisions to aid France. Making Paris into a ruin would not affect the final event. At the conference Pétain met de Gaulle for the first time in two years. Pétain noted his recent promotion to general, adding that he did not congratulate him, as ranks were of no use in defeat. When de Gaulle protested that Pétain himself had been promoted to brigadier-general and division commander at the Battle of the Marne in 1914, he replied that there was ""no comparison"" with the present situation. De Gaulle later conceded that Pétain was right about that much at least.[42]', 'On 12 June, after a second session of the conference, the cabinet met and Weygand again called for an armistice. He referred to the danger of military and civil disorder and the possibility of a Communist uprising in Paris. Pétain and Minister of Information Prouvost urged the cabinet to hear Weygand out because ""he was the only one really to know what was happening"".', 'Churchill returned to France on 13 June for another conference at Tours. Baudouin met his plane and immediately spoke to him of the hopelessness of further French resistance. Reynaud then put the cabinet\'s armistice proposals to Churchill, who replied that ""whatever happened, we would level no reproaches against France."" At that day\'s cabinet meeting, Pétain strongly supported Weygand’s demand for an armistice and read out a draft proposal to the cabinet where he spoke of ', 'the need to stay in France, to prepare a national revival, and to share the sufferings of our people. It is impossible for the government to abandon French soil without emigrating, without deserting. The duty of the government is, come what may, to remain in the country, or it could not longer be regarded as the government. ', 'Several ministers were still opposed to an armistice, and Weygand immediately lashed out at them for even leaving Paris. Like Pétain, he said he would never leave France.[43]', 'The government moved to Bordeaux on 14 June, where French governments had fled German invasions in 1870 and 1914. By coincidence, that evening in Bordeaux, de Gaulle dined in the same restaurant as Pétain; he came over to shake his hand in silence and they never met again.[43]', ""The Assembly, both Senate and Chamber, were also at Bordeaux and immersed themselves in the armistice debate. At cabinet on 15 June, Reynaud urged that France follow the Dutch example, that the Army should lay down its arms so that the fight could be continued from abroad. Pétain was sympathetic.[44] Pétain was sent to speak to Weygand (who was waiting outside, as he was not a member of the cabinet) for around fifteen minutes.[45] Weygand persuaded him that Reynaud's suggestion would be a shameful surrender. Chautemps then put forward a 'fudge' proposal, an enquiry about terms.[44] The Cabinet voted 13–6 for the Chautemps proposal. Admiral Darlan, who had been opposed to an armistice until 15 June, now became a key player, agreeing provided the French fleet was kept out of German hands.[45]"", ""On Sunday, 16 June 1940, President Roosevelt's reply to President Lebrun's requests for assistance came with only vague promises and saying that it was impossible for the President to do anything without Congressional approval. Pétain then drew a letter of resignation from his pocket, an act which was certain to bring down the government (he had persuaded Weygand to come to Bordeaux by telling him that 16 June would be the decisive day). Lebrun persuaded him to stay until Churchill’s reply had been received. After lunch, Churchill's telegram arrived agreeing to an armistice provided the French fleet was moved to British ports, a suggestion which was not acceptable to Darlan, who argued that it was outrageous and would leave France defenseless.[44]"", ""That afternoon, the British Government offered joint nationality for Frenchmen and Britons in a Franco-British Union. Reynaud and five ministers thought these proposals acceptable. The others did not, seeing the offer as insulting and a device to make France subservient to the United Kingdom, as a kind of extra Dominion. Contrary to President Albert Lebrun's later recollection, no formal vote appears to have been taken at Cabinet on 16 June.[46] The outcome of the meeting is uncertain.[44] Ten ministers wanted to fight on and seven favoured an armistice (but these included the two Deputy Prime Ministers Pétain and Camille Chautemps, and this view was also favoured by the Commander-in-Chief General Weygand). Eight were initially undecided but swung towards an armistice.[46]"", ""Lebrun reluctantly accepted Reynaud's resignation as Prime Minister on 17 June, Reynaud recommending to the President that he appoint Marshal Pétain in his place, which he did that day, while the government was at Bordeaux. Pétain already had a ministerial team ready:[47]"", 'A new Cabinet with Pétain as head of government was formed, with Henry du Moulin de Labarthète as the Cabinet Secretary.[48] At midnight on 17 June 1940, Baudouin asked the Spanish Ambassador to submit to Germany a request to cease hostilities at once and for Germany to make known its peace terms. At 12:30\xa0am, Pétain made his first broadcast to the French people.', '""The enthusiasm of the country for the Maréchal was tremendous. He was welcomed by people as diverse as Claudel, Gide, and Mauriac, and also by the vast mass of untutored Frenchmen who saw him as their saviour.""[49] General de Gaulle, no longer in the Cabinet, had arrived in London on 17 June and made a call for resistance from there on 18 June, a call that was heard by comparatively few.', ""Cabinet and Parliament still argued between themselves on the question of whether to retreat to North Africa. On 18 June, Édouard Herriot (who would later be a prosecution witness at Pétain's trial) and Jeanneney, the presidents of the two Chambers of Parliament, as well as Lebrun said they wanted to go. Pétain said he was not departing. On 20 June, a delegation from the two chambers came to Pétain to protest at the proposed departure of President Lebrun. The next day, they went to Lebrun himself. In the event, only 26 deputies and 1 senator headed for Africa, among them those with Jewish backgrounds, Georges Mandel, Pierre Mendès France, and the former Popular Front Education Minister, Jean Zay.[50] Pétain made a broadcast again to the French people on that day."", ""On 22 June 1940, France signed an armistice at Compiègne that gave Germany control over the north and west of the country, including Paris and all of the Atlantic coastline, but left the rest, around two-fifths of France's prewar territory, unoccupied. Paris remained the de jure capital. On 29 June, the French government moved to Clermont-Ferrand where the first discussions of constitutional changes were mooted, with Pierre Laval having personal discussions with President Lebrun, who had, in the event, not left France. On 1 July, the government, finding Clermont too cramped, moved to Vichy at Baudouin's suggestion, the empty hotels there being more suitable for the government ministries."", 'The Chamber of Deputies and Senate, meeting together as a ""Congrès"", held an emergency meeting on 10 July to ratify the armistice. At the same time, the draft constitutional proposals were tabled. The presidents of both Chambers spoke and declared that constitutional reform was necessary. The Congress voted 569–80 (with 18 abstentions) to grant the Cabinet the authority to draw up a new constitution, effectively ""voting the Third Republic out of existence"".[51] Nearly all French historians, as well as all postwar French governments, consider this vote to be illegal; not only were several deputies and senators not present, but the constitution explicitly stated that the republican form of government could not be changed, though it could be argued that a republican dictatorship was installed. On the next day, Pétain formally assumed near-absolute powers as ""Head of State"".[note 1]', 'Pétain was reactionary by temperament and education, and quickly began blaming the Third Republic and its endemic corruption for the French defeat. His regime soon took on clear authoritarian\xa0– and in some cases, fascist\xa0– characteristics. The republican motto of ""Liberté, égalité, fraternité"" (""Freedom, equality, brotherhood"") was replaced with ""Travail, famille, patrie"" (""Work, family, fatherland"").[54]  He issued new constitutional acts which abolished the presidency, indefinitely adjourned parliament, and also gave him full power to appoint and fire ministers and civil service members, pass laws through the Council of Ministers, and designate a successor (he chose Laval).  Though Pétain publicly stated that he had no desire to become ""a Caesar"",[55] by January 1941, Pétain held virtually all governing power in France; nearly all legislative, executive, and judicial powers were either de jure or de facto in his hands. One of his advisors commented that he had more power than any French leader since Louis XIV.[34]  Fascistic and revolutionary conservative factions within the new government used the opportunity to launch an ambitious programme known as the ""Révolution nationale"", which rejected much of the former Third Republic\'s secular and liberal traditions in favour of an authoritarian and paternalist society. Pétain, amongst others, took exception to the use of the term ""revolution"" to describe what he believed to be an essentially conservative movement, but otherwise participated in the transformation of French society from ""Republic"" to ""State"". He added that the new France would be ""a social hierarchy... rejecting the false idea of the natural equality of men.""[56]', 'The new government immediately used its new powers to order harsh measures, including the dismissal of republican civil servants, the installation of exceptional jurisdictions, the proclamation of antisemitic laws, and the imprisonment of opponents and foreign refugees. Censorship was imposed, and freedom of expression and thought were effectively abolished with the reinstatement of the crime of ""felony of opinion"". Pétain was always aware of civil discontent over Vichy rule.', 'On 24 June the British government stated that France had broken its agreement with the United Kingdom. At the beginning of the war it had been agreed that neither the United Kingdom nor France would make a separate peace[57]:559. The United Kingdom was prepared to release France from the agreement, providing the French fleet sailed forthwith to British harbours or to a neutral country, so it was out of reach of the Germans, pending negotiations[58]:367. Notwithstanding the agreement between the United Kingdom and France and in complete disregard of her obligations to the United Kingdom, France allowed her fleet to fall into Germany’s hands[57]:537. Further, Paul Reynaud agreed with the United Kingdom that if peace was made with Germany, German airmen who were prisoners of war would be sent to the United Kingdom[57]:497. Again, the Pétain Government did not honour this pledge and the German airmen, many of whom had been shot down by the RAF, were returned to Germany[57]:497.', 'In a radio address to the country on 12 August 1941, Pétain stated;', '""From several regions of France, I have felt an ill-wind rising for some time... the authority of my government is contested... a genuine malaise is gripping the French people"".[59]', 'The regime organised a ""Légion Française des Combattants,"" which included ""Friends of the Legion"" and ""Cadets of the Legion"", groups of those who had never fought but were politically attached to the new regime. Pétain championed a rural and reactionary France that spurned internationalism. As a retired military commander, he ran the country on military lines.', ""Within months, Pétain signed antisemitic ordinances. This included the Law on the status of Jews, prohibiting Jews from exercising numerous professions, and the Law regarding foreign nationals of the Jewish race, authorizing the detention of foreign Jews.Pétain's government was nevertheless internationally recognised, notably by the U.S., at least until the German occupation of the rest of France. Neither Pétain nor his successive deputies, Laval, Pierre-Étienne Flandin, or Admiral François Darlan, gave significant resistance to requests by the Germans to indirectly aid the Axis powers."", 'When Hitler met Pétain at Montoire in October 1940 to discuss the French government\'s role in the new ""European Order"", the handshake he offered to Hitler caused much uproar in London, and probably influenced by the United Kingdom decision to lend Free France naval support for their operations in Gabon.[60] Furthermore, France even remained formally at war with Germany, albeit opposed to the Free French. Following the British attacks of July and September 1940 (Mers-el-Kébir, Dakar), the French government became increasingly fearful of the British and took the initiative to collaborate with the occupiers. Pétain accepted the government\'s creation of a collaborationist armed militia (the Milice) under the command of Joseph Darnand, who, along with German forces, led a campaign of repression against the French resistance (""Maquis"").', 'Pétain admitted Darnand into his government as Secretary of the Maintenance of Public Order (Secrétaire d\'État au Maintien de l\'Ordre). In August 1944, Pétain tried to distance himself from the crimes of the Milice by writing Darnand a letter of reprimand for the organisation\'s ""excesses"". Darnand sarcastically replied that Pétain should have ""thought of this before"".', ""Pétain's government acquiesced to Axis demands for large supplies of manufactured goods and foodstuffs, and also ordered French troops in the French colonial empire (in Dakar, Syria, Madagascar, Oran, and Morocco) to defend sovereign French territory against any aggressors, Allied or otherwise."", 'Pétain\'s motives are a topic of wide conjecture. Winston Churchill had spoken to Reynaud during the impending fall of France, saying of Pétain, ""... he had always been a defeatist, even in the last war [World War I].""[61]', 'On 11 November 1942, German forces invaded the unoccupied zone of Southern France in response to Allied landings in North Africa and Admiral Darlan\'s agreement to support the Allies. Although the French government nominally remained in existence, civilian administration of almost all France being under it, Pétain became nothing more than a figurehead, as the Germans had negated the pretence of an ""independent"" government at Vichy. Pétain however remained popular and engaged in a series of visits around France as late as 1944, when he arrived in Paris on 28 April in what Nazi propaganda newsreels described as a ""historic"" moment for the city. Large crowds cheered him in front of the Hôtel de Ville and in the streets.[62]', 'On 17 August 1944, the Germans, in the person of Cecil von Renthe-Fink, ""special diplomatic delegate of the Führer to the French Head of State"", asked Pétain to allow himself to be transferred to the northern zone.[63] Pétain refused and asked for a written formulation of this request.[63] Renthe-Fink renewed his request twice on the 18th, then returned on the 19th, at 11:30, accompanied by General Alexander Neubronn von Eisenberg, who told him that he had ""formal orders from Berlin"".[63]The written text was submitted to Pétain: ""The Reich Government instructs the transfer of the Head of State, even against his will"".[63] Faced with the Marshal\'s continued refusal, the Germans threatened to bring in the Wehrmacht to bomb Vichy.[63]After having requested the Swiss ambassador Walter Stucki\xa0[fr] to bear witness to the Germans\' blackmail, Pétain submitted. When Renthe-Fink entered the Marshal\'s office at the Hôtel du Parc with General Neubronn ""at 7:30 p.m."", the Head of State was supervising the packing up of his suitcases and papers.[63] The next day, 20 August 1944, Pétain was taken against his will by the German army to Belfort.', 'Following the liberation of France, on 8 September 1944, Pétain and other members of the French cabinet at Vichy were relocated by the Germans to the Sigmaringen enclave in Germany, where they became a government-in-exile until April 1945. Pétain, however, having been forced to leave France, refused to participate in this government and Fernand de Brinon now headed the ""government commission"".[64] In a note dated 29 October 1944, Pétain forbade de Brinon to use the Marshal\'s name in any connection with this new government, and on 5 April 1945, Pétain wrote a note to Hitler expressing his wish to return to France. No reply ever came. However, on his birthday almost three weeks later, he was taken to the Swiss border. Two days later he crossed the French frontier.[65]', 'The provisional government, headed by de Gaulle, placed Pétain on trial for treason, the trial taking place from 23 July to 15 August 1945. Dressed in the uniform of a Marshal of France, Pétain remained silent through most of the proceedings after an initial statement that denied the right of the High Court as it was constituted to try him. De Gaulle later said ', 'Too often, the discussions took on the appearance of a partisan trial, sometimes even a settling of scores, when the whole affair should have been treated only from the standpoint of national defence and independence.[66]', ""At the end of Pétain's trial, he was convicted on all charges, including indignité nationale. The jury sentenced him to death and confiscation of his property. Due to his advanced age, the court asked that the sentence not be carried out. De Gaulle, who was President of the Provisional Government of the French Republic at the end of the war, commuted the sentence to life imprisonment on the grounds of age.[67] After his conviction, the court stripped Pétain of all military ranks and honours, not including the distinction of Marshal of France.[68][better\xa0source\xa0needed]"", ""Fearing riots at the announcement of the sentence,[clarification needed] de Gaulle ordered that Pétain be immediately transported on the former's private aircraft to Fort du Portalet in the Pyrenees,[69] where he remained from 15 August to 16 November 1945. The government later transferred him to the Fort de Pierre-Levée citadel on the Île d'Yeu, a small island off the French Atlantic coast.[70]"", ""Over the following years Pétain's lawyers and many foreign governments and dignitaries, including Queen Mary and the Duke of Windsor, appealed to successive French governments for Pétain's release, but given the unstable state of Fourth Republic politics, no government was willing to risk unpopularity by releasing him. As early as June 1946, U.S. President Harry S. Truman interceded in vain for his release, even offering to provide political asylum in the U.S.[71] A similar offer was later made by the Spanish dictator General Francisco Franco.[71]"", 'Although Pétain had still been in good health for his age at the time of his imprisonment, by late 1947, he suffered from memory lapses.[72] By January 1949, his lucid intervals were becoming fewer and fewer. On 3 March 1949, a meeting of the Council of Ministers, many of its members ""self-proclaimed heroes of the Resistance"" in the words of biographer Charles Williams, had a fierce argument about a medical report recommending that he be moved to Val-de-Grâce (a military hospital in Paris), a measure to which Prime Minister Henri Queuille had previously been sympathetic. By May, Pétain required constant nursing care, and often suffered from hallucinations, e.g. that he was commanding armies in battle, or that naked women were dancing around his room.[73] By the end of 1949, Pétain was suffering from severe cognitive impairment, with only occasional moments of lucidity. He was also beginning to suffer from heart problems and was no longer able to walk without assistance. Plans were made for his death and funeral.[74]', 'On 8 June 1951, President Vincent Auriol, informed that Pétain did not have much longer to live, commuted his sentence to confinement in hospital; the news was kept secret until after the elections on 17 June, but by then, Pétain was too ill to be moved to Paris.[75]', ""Pétain died in a private home in Port-Joinville\xa0[fr] on the Île d'Yeu on 23 July 1951, at the age of 95.[70] His body was buried in a local cemetery (Cimetière communal de Port-Joinville).[32] Calls were made to relocate his remains to the grave prepared for him at Verdun.[76]"", 'Surrounded by thujas and cypresses, the simple white granite slab topped with a wooden cross is in front of the west wall of the cemetery, facing away from the sea in the opposite direction to the 1,700 other tombs, a positioning linked to the fact that he was condemned to Indignité nationale[77], a sanction which did not prevent him from being buried in his military uniform and that the mention of Marshal of France was engraved in black capital letters.', ""In February 1973, Pétain's coffin housing his remains was stolen from the Île d'Yeu cemetery by extremists who demanded that President Georges Pompidou consent to its re-interment at Douaumont ossuary among the war dead of the Battle of Verdun. Police recovered the coffin a few days later, and it was ceremoniously reburied with a presidential wreath on the Île d'Yeu where it had been buried before.[78]"", 'A small museum glorifying Pétain, the Historical Museum of the Île d’Yeu, displays writings and personal items of Pétain, such as his deathbed, his clothes and his cane. The museum is not publicized and rarely opens – according to its manager, to ""avoid trouble"".[79]', 'Mount Pétain, nearby Pétain Creek, and Pétain Falls, forming the Pétain Basin on the Continental Divide in the Canadian Rockies, were named after him in 1919,[80] while nearby summits were given the names of other French generals (Foch, Cordonnier, Mangin, Castelnau and Joffre). The names referring to Pétain were removed in 2021 and 2022, leaving the features unnamed.[81]', 'Hengshan Road, in Shanghai, was ""Avenue Pétain"" between 1922 and 1943. There is a Petain Road in Singapore in the Little India neighbourhood. Pinardville, a traditionally French-Canadian neighborhood of Goffstown, New Hampshire, has a Petain Street dating from the 1920s, alongside parallel streets named for other World War I generals, John Pershing, Douglas Haig, Ferdinand Foch, and Joseph Joffre.', ""On 26 October 1931, Pétain was honored with a ticker-tape parade down Manhattan's Canyon of Heroes. In 2017, the New York City Mayor's Office considered removing the sidewalk ribbon denoting the parade for Pétain, given his role with the Nazis in World War II.[82]"", ""Pétain was a bachelor until his sixties and known for his womanising.[1][page\xa0needed] After World War I Pétain married his mistress, Eugénie Hardon (1877–1962), on 14 September 1920; they remained married until the end of Pétain's life.[83] After rejecting Pétain's first marriage proposal, Hardon had married and divorced François de Hérain by 1914 when she was 35. At the opening of the Battle of Verdun in 1916 Pétain is said to have been fetched during the night from a Paris hotel by a staff officer who knew that he could be found with Eugénie Hardon.[84] She had no children by Pétain but already had a son from her first marriage, Pierre de Hérain, whom Pétain strongly disliked.[72]"", 'Marshal of France: 21 November 1918 (the sole award retained following his trial in 1945)', 'Following honours and decorations withdrawn following conviction for high treason in 1945:[92]', 'Among a vast number of books and articles about Pétain, the most complete and documented biographies are:']","Henri Philippe Bénoni Omer Joseph Pétain (24 April 1856 – 23 July 1951), better known as Philippe Pétain (French: [filip petɛ̃]) and Marshal Pétain (French: Maréchal Pétain), was a French general who commanded the French Army in World War I and later became the head of the collaborationist regime of Vichy France, from 1940 to 1944, during World War II.","Here is a summary of Marshal Philippe Pétain's life:

Benito_Mussolini,"['Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini[a] (29 July 1883\xa0– 28 April 1945) was an Italian dictator who founded and led the National Fascist Party (PNF). He was Prime Minister of Italy from the March on Rome in 1922, until his deposition in 1943, as well as Duce of Italian fascism from the establishment of the Italian Fasces of Combat in 1919, until his summary execution in 1945. As a dictator and founder of fascism, Mussolini inspired the international spread of fascist movements during the interwar period.[1]', 'Mussolini was originally a socialist politician and journalist at the Avanti! newspaper. In 1912, he became a member of the National Directorate of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), but was expelled for advocating military intervention in World War I. In 1914, Mussolini founded a newspaper, Il Popolo d\'Italia, and served in the Royal Italian Army until he was wounded and discharged in 1917. He eventually denounced the PSI, his views now centering on Italian nationalism, and founded the fascist movement which opposed egalitarianism and class conflict, instead advocating ""revolutionary nationalism"" transcending class lines. In October 1922, following the March on Rome, he was appointed prime minister by King Victor Emmanuel III. After removing opposition through his secret police and outlawing labour strikes, Mussolini and his followers consolidated power through laws that transformed the nation into a one-party dictatorship. Within five years, he established dictatorial authority by legal and illegal means and aspired to create a totalitarian state. In 1929, he signed the Lateran Treaty to establish Vatican City.', 'Mussolini\'s foreign policy was based on the fascist doctrine of ""Spazio vitale"" (""living space""), which aimed to expand Italian possessions. In the 1920s, he ordered the Pacification of Libya, the bombing of Corfu over an incident with Greece, and annexed Fiume, after a treaty with Yugoslavia. In 1936, Ethiopia was conquered following the Second Italo-Ethiopian War and merged into Italian East Africa (AOI) with Eritrea and Somalia. In 1939, Italian forces annexed Albania. Between 1936 and 1939, Mussolini ordered an intervention in Spain in favour of Francisco Franco, during the Spanish Civil War. Mussolini took part in the Treaty of Lausanne, Four-Power Pact and Stresa Front. However, he alienated the democratic powers as tensions grew in the League of Nations, which he left in 1937. Now hostile to France and Britain, Italy formed the Axis alliance with Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan.', ""The wars of the 1930s cost Italy enormous resources, leaving it unprepared for the Second World War; Mussolini initially declared Italy's non-belligerence. However, in June 1940, believing Allied defeat imminent, he joined the war on Germany's side, to share the spoils. After the tide turned, and the Allied invasion of Sicily, King Victor Emmanuel III dismissed Mussolini as head of government and placed him in custody in July 1943. After the king agreed to an armistice with the Allies, in September 1943, Mussolini was rescued in the Gran Sasso raid by Germany. Hitler made Mussolini the figurehead of a puppet state in German-occupied north Italy, the Italian Social Republic, which served as a collaborationist regime of the Germans. With Allied victory imminent, Mussolini and mistress Clara Petacci attempted to flee to Switzerland, but were captured by communist partisans and executed on 28 April 1945."", 'Mussolini was born on 29 July 1883 in Dovia di Predappio, a small town in the province of Forlì in Romagna. During the Fascist era, Predappio was dubbed ""Duce\'s town"" and Forlì was called ""Duce\'s city"", with pilgrims going to Predappio and Forlì to see the birthplace of Mussolini.', ""Benito Mussolini's father, Alessandro Mussolini, was a blacksmith and a socialist,[2] while his mother, Rosa (née Maltoni), was a devout Catholic schoolteacher.[3] Given his father's political leanings, Mussolini was named Benito after liberal Mexican president Benito Juárez, while his middle names, Andrea and Amilcare, were for Italian socialists Andrea Costa and Amilcare Cipriani.[4] In return his mother required that he be baptised at birth.[3] Benito was followed by his siblings Arnaldo and Edvige.[5][6]"", ""As a young boy, Mussolini helped his father in his smithy.[7] Mussolini's early political views were strongly influenced by his father, who idolised 19th-century Italian nationalist figures with humanist tendencies such as Carlo Pisacane, Giuseppe Mazzini, and Giuseppe Garibaldi.[8] His father's political outlook combined views of anarchist figures such as Carlo Cafiero and Mikhail Bakunin, the military authoritarianism of Garibaldi, and the nationalism of Mazzini. In 1902, at the anniversary of Garibaldi's death, Mussolini made a public speech in praise of the republican nationalist.[9]"", 'Mussolini was sent to a boarding school in Faenza run by Salesians.[10] Despite being shy, he often clashed with teachers and fellow boarders due to his proud, grumpy, and violent behaviour.[3] During an argument, he injured a classmate with a penknife and was severely punished.[3] After joining a new non-religious school in Forlimpopoli, Mussolini achieved good grades, was appreciated by his teachers despite his violent character, and qualified as an elementary schoolmaster in July 1901.[3][11]', 'In July 1902, Mussolini emigrated to Switzerland, partly to avoid compulsory military service.[2][12] He worked briefly as a stonemason but was unable to find a permanent job.', ""During this time he studied the ideas of the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, the sociologist Vilfredo Pareto, and the syndicalist Georges Sorel. Mussolini also later credited Charles Péguy and Hubert Lagardelle as influences.[13] Sorel's emphasis on the need for overthrowing decadent liberal democracy and capitalism by the use of violence, direct action, the general strike, and the use of neo-Machiavellian appeals to emotion, impressed Mussolini deeply.[2]"", ""Mussolini became active in the Italian socialist movement in Switzerland, working for the paper L'Avvenire del Lavoratore (The Future of the Worker), organising meetings, giving speeches to workers, and serving as secretary of the Italian workers' union in Lausanne.[12] Angelica Balabanov reportedly introduced him to Vladimir Lenin, who later criticised Italian socialists for having lost Mussolini from their cause.[14] In 1903, he was arrested by Bernese police because of his advocacy of a violent general strike, spent two weeks in jail, and was handed over to Italian police in Chiasso.[12] After he was released in Italy, he returned to Switzerland.[15] He was arrested again in Geneva, in April 1904, for falsifying his passport expiration date, and was expelled from the canton of Geneva.[12] He was released in Bellinzona following protests from Genevan socialists.[12] Mussolini then returned to Lausanne, where he entered the University of Lausanne's Department of Social Science on 7 May 1904, attending the lectures of Vilfredo Pareto.[12][16] In 1937, when he was prime minister of Italy, the University of Lausanne awarded Mussolini an honorary doctorate.[17]"", 'In December 1904, Mussolini returned to Italy to take advantage of an amnesty for desertion from the military. He had been convicted for this in absentia.[12] Since a condition for being pardoned was serving in the army, he joined the corps of the Bersaglieri in Forlì on 30 December 1904.[18] After serving for two years in the military (from January 1905 until September 1906), he returned to teaching.[19]', ""In February 1909,[20] Mussolini again left Italy, this time to take the job as the secretary of the labour party in the Italian-speaking city of Trento, then part of Austria-Hungary. He also did office work for the local Socialist Party, and edited its newspaper L'Avvenire del Lavoratore (The Future of the Worker). Returning to Italy, he spent a brief time in Milan, and in 1910 he returned to his hometown of Forlì, where he edited the weekly Lotta di classe (The Class Struggle)."", 'Mussolini thought of himself as an intellectual and was considered to be well-read. He read avidly; his favourites in European philosophy included Sorel, the Italian Futurist Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, French Socialist Gustave Hervé, Italian anarchist Errico Malatesta, and German philosophers Friedrich Engels and Karl Marx, the founders of Marxism.[21][22] Mussolini had taught himself French and German and translated excerpts from Nietzsche, Schopenhauer and Kant.', ""During this time, he published Il Trentino veduto da un Socialista (Trentino as viewed by a Socialist) in the radical periodical La Voce.[23] He also wrote several essays about German literature, some stories, and one novel: L'amante del Cardinale: Claudia Particella, romanzo storico (The Cardinal's Mistress). This novel he co-wrote with Santi Corvaja, and it was published as a serial book in the Trento newspaper Il Popolo from 20 January to 11 May 1910.[24] The novel was bitterly anticlerical, and years later was withdrawn from circulation after Mussolini made a truce with the Vatican.[2]"", 'He had become one of Italy\'s most prominent socialists. In September 1911, Mussolini participated in a riot, led by socialists, against the Italian war in Libya. He bitterly denounced Italy\'s ""imperialist war,"" an action that earned him a five-month jail term.[25] After his release, he helped expel Ivanoe Bonomi and Leonida Bissolati from the Socialist Party, as they were two ""revisionists"" who had supported the war.', 'In 1912, he became a member of the National Directorate of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI).[26] He was rewarded with the editorship of the Socialist Party newspaper Avanti! Under his leadership, its circulation soon rose from 20,000 to 100,000.[27] John Gunther in 1940 called him ""one of the best journalists alive""; Mussolini was a working reporter while preparing for the March on Rome, and wrote for the Hearst News Service until 1935.[14] Mussolini was so familiar with Marxist literature that in his writings he would not only quote from well-known Marxist works but also from the relatively obscure works.[28] During this period Mussolini considered himself an ""authoritarian communist""[29] and a Marxist and he described Karl Marx as ""the greatest of all theorists of socialism.""[30]', 'In 1913, he published Giovanni Hus, il veridico (Jan Hus, true prophet), a historical and political biography about the life and mission of the Czech ecclesiastic reformer Jan Hus and his militant followers, the Hussites. During this socialist period of his life, Mussolini sometimes used the pen name ""Vero Eretico"" (""sincere heretic"").[31]', ""Mussolini rejected egalitarianism,[32] a core doctrine of socialism.[32] He was influenced by Nietzsche's anti-Christian ideas and negation of God's existence.[33] Mussolini felt that socialism had faltered, in view of the failures of Marxist determinism and social democratic reformism, and believed that Nietzsche's ideas would strengthen socialism. Mussolini's writings came to reflect an abandonment of Marxism and egalitarianism in favour of Nietzsche's übermensch concept and anti-egalitarianism.[33]"", ""When World War I began in August 1914, many socialist parties worldwide followed the rising nationalist current and supported their country's intervention in the war.[34][35] In Italy, the outbreak of the war created a surge of Italian nationalism and intervention was supported by a variety of political factions. One of the most prominent and popular Italian nationalist supporters of the war was Gabriele d'Annunzio who promoted Italian irredentism and helped sway the Italian public to support intervention.[36] The Italian Liberal Party under the leadership of Paolo Boselli promoted intervention on the side of the Allies and utilised the Società Dante Alighieri to promote Italian nationalism.[37][38] Italian socialists were divided on whether to support the war.[39] Prior to Mussolini taking a position on the war, a number of revolutionary syndicalists had announced their support of intervention, including Alceste De Ambris, Filippo Corridoni, and Angelo Oliviero Olivetti.[40] The Italian Socialist Party decided to oppose the war after anti-militarist protestors had been killed, resulting in a general strike called Red Week.[41]"", 'Mussolini initially held official support for the party\'s decision and, in an August 1914 article, Mussolini wrote ""Down with the War. We remain neutral."" He saw the war as an opportunity, both for his own ambitions as well as those of socialists and Italians. He was influenced by anti-Austrian Italian nationalist sentiments, believing that the war offered Italians in Austria-Hungary the chance to liberate themselves from rule of the Habsburgs. He eventually decided to declare support for the war by appealing to the need for socialists to overthrow the Hohenzollern and Habsburg monarchies in Germany and Austria-Hungary who he said had consistently repressed socialism.[42]', 'Mussolini further justified his position by denouncing the Central Powers for being reactionary powers; for pursuing imperialist designs against Belgium and Serbia as well as historically against Denmark, France, and against Italians, since hundreds of thousands of Italians were under Habsburg rule. He argued that the fall of Hohenzollern and Habsburg monarchies and the repression of ""reactionary"" Turkey would create conditions beneficial for the working class, and that the mobilisation required for the war would undermine Russia\'s reactionary authoritarianism and bring Russia to social revolution. He said that for Italy the war would complete the process of Risorgimento by uniting the Italians in Austria-Hungary into Italy and by allowing the common people of Italy to be participating members in what would be Italy\'s first national war. Thus he claimed that the vast social changes that the war could offer meant that it should be supported as a revolutionary war.[40]', ""As Mussolini's support for the intervention solidified, he came into conflict with socialists who opposed the war. He attacked the opponents of the war and claimed that those proletarians who supported pacifism were out of step with the proletarians who had joined the rising interventionist vanguard that was preparing Italy for a revolutionary war. He began to criticise the Italian Socialist Party and socialism itself for having failed to recognise the national problems that had led to the outbreak of the war.[43] He was expelled from the party for his support of intervention."", 'A police report prepared by the Inspector-General of Public Security in Milan, G. Gasti, describes his background and his position on the First World War that resulted in his ousting from the Italian Socialist Party:', ""Professor Benito Mussolini,\xa0... 38, revolutionary socialist, has a police record; elementary school teacher qualified to teach in secondary schools; former first secretary of the Chambers in Cesena, Forlì, and Ravenna; after 1912 editor of the newspaper Avanti! to which he gave a violent suggestive and intransigent orientation. In October 1914, finding himself in opposition to the directorate of the Italian Socialist party because he advocated a kind of active neutrality on the part of Italy in the War of the Nations against the party's tendency of absolute neutrality, he withdrew on the twentieth of that month from the directorate of Avanti! Then on the fifteenth of November [1914], thereafter, he initiated publication of the newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia, in which he supported—in sharp contrast to Avanti! and amid bitter polemics against that newspaper and its chief backers—the thesis of Italian intervention in the war against the militarism of the Central Empires. For this reason he was accused of moral and political unworthiness and the party thereupon decided to expel him\xa0... Thereafter he\xa0... undertook a very active campaign in behalf of Italian intervention, participating in demonstrations in the piazzas and writing quite violent articles in Popolo d'Italia\xa0...[27]"", 'In his summary, the Inspector also noted:', 'He was the ideal editor of Avanti! for the Socialists. In that line of work he was greatly esteemed and beloved. Some of his former comrades and admirers still confess that there was no one who understood better how to interpret the spirit of the proletariat and there was no one who did not observe his apostasy with sorrow. This came about not for reasons of self-interest or money. He was a sincere and passionate advocate, first of vigilant and armed neutrality, and later of war; and he did not believe that he was compromising with his personal and political honesty by making use of every means—no matter where they came from or wherever he might obtain them—to pay for his newspaper, his program and his line of action. This was his initial line. It is difficult to say to what extent his socialist convictions (which he never either openly or privately abjure) may have been sacrificed in the course of the indispensable financial deals which were necessary for the continuation of the struggle in which he was engaged\xa0... But assuming these modifications did take place\xa0... he always wanted to give the appearance of still being a socialist, and he fooled himself into thinking that this was the case.[44]', 'After being ousted by the Italian Socialist Party, Mussolini made a radical transformation, ending his support for class conflict and joining in support of revolutionary nationalism transcending class lines.[43] He formed the interventionist newspaper Il Popolo d\'Italia and the  Fascio Rivoluzionario d\'Azione Internazionalista (""Revolutionary Fasces of International Action"") in October 1914.[38] The funds to create Il Popolo d\'Italia—funneled through entrepreneur Filippo Naldi\xa0[it]—came from many sources, including domestic industrial and agrarian interests, such as the engineering giants Fiat and Ansaldo, and the governments of France and Britain.[b][45][47][48]', 'On 5 December 1914, Mussolini denounced orthodox socialism for failing to recognise that the war had made national identity and loyalty more significant than class distinction.[43] He fully demonstrated his transformation in a speech that acknowledged the nation as an entity, a notion he had rejected prior to the war, saying:', 'The nation has not disappeared. We used to believe that the concept was totally without substance. Instead we see the nation arise as a palpitating reality before us!\xa0... Class cannot destroy the nation. Class reveals itself as a collection of interests—but the nation is a history of sentiments, traditions, language, culture, and race. Class can become an integral part of the nation, but the one cannot eclipse the other.[49]The class struggle is a vain formula, without effect and consequence wherever one finds a people that has not integrated itself into its proper linguistic and racial confines—where the national problem has not been definitely resolved. In such circumstances the class movement finds itself impaired by an inauspicious historic climate.[50]', ""Mussolini continued to promote the need of a revolutionary vanguard elite to lead society. He no longer advocated a proletarian vanguard, but instead a vanguard led by dynamic and revolutionary people of any social class.[50] Though he denounced orthodox socialism and class conflict, he maintained at the time that he was a nationalist socialist and a supporter of the legacy of nationalist socialists in Italy's history, such as Giuseppe Garibaldi, Giuseppe Mazzini, and Carlo Pisacane. As for the Italian Socialist Party and its support of orthodox socialism, he claimed that his failure as a member of the party to revitalise and transform it to recognise the contemporary reality revealed the hopelessness of orthodox socialism as outdated and a failure.[51] This perception of the failure of orthodox socialism in the light of the outbreak of World War I was not solely held by Mussolini; other pro-interventionist Italian socialists such as Filippo Corridoni and Sergio Panunzio had also denounced classical Marxism in favour of intervention.[52]"", ""These basic political views and principles formed the basis of Mussolini's newly formed political movement, the Fasci d'Azione Rivoluzionaria in 1914, who called themselves Fascisti (Fascists).[53] At this time, the Fascists did not have an integrated set of policies and the movement was small, ineffective in its attempts to hold mass meetings, and was regularly harassed by government authorities and orthodox socialists.[54] Antagonism between the interventionists versus the anti-interventionist orthodox socialists resulted in violence between the Fascists and socialists. These early hostilities between the Fascists and the revolutionary socialists shaped Mussolini's conception of the nature of Fascism in its support of political violence.[55]"", 'Mussolini became an ally with the irredentist politician and journalist Cesare Battisti.[27] When World War I started, Mussolini, like many Italian nationalists, volunteered to fight. He was turned down because of his radical Socialism and told to wait for his reserve call up. He was called up on 31 August and reported for duty with his old unit, the Bersaglieri. After a two-week refresher course he was sent to Isonzo front where he took part in the Second Battle of the Isonzo, September 1915. His unit also took part in the Third Battle of the Isonzo, October 1915.[56]', 'The Inspector General continued:', 'He was promoted to the rank of corporal ""for merit in war"". The promotion was recommended because of his exemplary conduct and fighting quality, his mental calmness and lack of concern for discomfort, his zeal and regularity in carrying out his assignments, where he was always first in every task involving labor and fortitude.[27]', ""Mussolini's military experience is told in his work Diario di guerra. He totalled about nine months of active, front-line trench warfare. During this time, he contracted paratyphoid fever.[57] His military exploits ended in February 1917 when he was wounded accidentally by the explosion of a mortar bomb in his trench. He was left with at least 40 shards of metal in his body and had to be evacuated from the front.[56][57] He was discharged from the hospital in August 1917 and resumed his editor-in-chief position at his new paper, Il Popolo d'Italia."", 'On 25 December 1915, in Treviglio, he married his compatriot Rachele Guidi, who had already borne him a daughter, Edda, at Forlì in 1910. In 1915, he had a son with Ida Dalser, a woman born in Sopramonte, a village near Trento.[11][4][58] He legally recognised this son on 11 January 1916.', 'By the time he returned from service in the Allied forces of World War I, Mussolini was convinced that socialism as a doctrine had largely been a failure. In early 1918 he called for the emergence of a man ""ruthless and energetic enough to make a clean sweep"" to revive the Italian nation.[59] On 23 March 1919 Mussolini re-formed the Milan fascio as the Fasci Italiani di Combattimento (Italian Combat Squad), consisting of 200 members.[60]', ""The ideological basis for fascism came from a number of sources. Mussolini drew from the works of Plato, Georges Sorel, Nietzsche, and the economic ideas of Vilfredo Pareto. Mussolini admired Plato's The Republic, which he often read for inspiration.[61] The Republic expounded a number of ideas that fascism promoted, such as rule by an elite promoting the state as the ultimate end, opposition to democracy, protecting the class system and promoting class collaboration, rejection of egalitarianism, promoting the militarisation of a nation by creating a class of warriors, demanding that citizens perform civic duties in the interest of the state, and utilising state intervention in education to promote the development of warriors and future rulers of the state.[62]"", ""The idea behind Mussolini's foreign policy was that of spazio vitale (vital space), a concept in Italian Fascism that was analogous to Lebensraum in German National Socialism.[63] The concept of spazio vitale was first announced in 1919, when the entire Mediterranean, especially so-called Julian March, was redefined to make it appear a unified region that had belonged to Italy from the times of the ancient Roman province of Italia,[64][65] and was claimed as Italy's exclusive sphere of influence. The right to colonise the neighbouring Slovene ethnic areas and the Mediterranean, being inhabited by what were alleged to be less developed peoples, was justified on the grounds that Italy was allegedly suffering from overpopulation.[66]"", 'Borrowing the idea first developed by Enrico Corradini before 1914 of the natural conflict between ""plutocratic"" nations like Britain and ""proletarian"" nations like Italy, Mussolini claimed that Italy\'s principal problem was that ""plutocratic"" countries like Britain were blocking Italy from achieving the necessary spazio vitale that would let the Italian economy grow.[67] Mussolini equated a nation\'s potential for economic growth with territorial size, thus in his view the problem of poverty in Italy could only be solved by winning the necessary spazio vitale.[68]', 'Though biological racism was less prominent in Italian Fascism than in National Socialism, right from the start the spazio vitale concept had a strong racist undercurrent. Mussolini asserted there was a ""natural law"" for stronger peoples to subject and dominate ""inferior"" peoples such as the ""barbaric"" Slavic peoples of Yugoslavia. He stated in a September 1920 speech: ', 'When dealing with such a race as Slavic—inferior and barbarian—we must not pursue the carrot, but the stick policy\xa0... We should not be afraid of new victims\xa0... The Italian border should run across the Brenner Pass, Monte Nevoso and the Dinaric Alps\xa0... I would say we can easily sacrifice 500,000 barbaric Slavs for 50,000 Italians\xa0... ', 'In the same way, Mussolini argued that Italy was right to follow an imperialist policy in Africa because he saw all black people as ""inferior"" to whites.[71] Mussolini claimed that the world was divided into a hierarchy of races (though this was justified more on cultural than on biological grounds), and that history was nothing more than a Darwinian struggle for power and territory between various ""racial masses"".[71] Mussolini saw high birthrates in Africa and Asia as a threat to the ""white race"". Mussolini believed that the United States was doomed as the American blacks had a higher birthrate than whites, making it inevitable that the blacks would take over the United States to drag it down to their level.[72] The fact that Italy was suffering from overpopulation was seen as proving the cultural and spiritual vitality of the Italians, who were thus justified in seeking to colonise lands that Mussolini argued—on a historical basis—belonged to Italy anyway. In Mussolini\'s thinking, demography was destiny; nations with rising populations were nations destined to conquer; and nations with falling populations were decaying powers that deserved to die. Hence, the importance of natalism to Mussolini, since only by increasing the birth rate could Italy ensure its future as a great power. By Mussolini\'s reckoning, the Italian population had to reach 60\xa0million to enable Italy to fight a major war—hence his relentless demands for Italian women to have more children.[71]', 'Mussolini and the fascists managed to be simultaneously revolutionary and traditionalist;[73][74] because this was vastly different from anything else in the political climate of the time, it is sometimes described as ""The Third Way"".[75] The Fascisti, led by one of Mussolini\'s close confidants, Dino Grandi, formed armed squads of war veterans called blackshirts (or squadristi) with the goal of restoring order to the streets of Italy with a strong hand. The blackshirts clashed with communists, socialists, and anarchists at parades and demonstrations; all of these factions were also involved in clashes against each other. The Italian government rarely interfered with the blackshirts\' actions, owing in part to a looming threat and widespread fear of a communist revolution. The Fascisti grew rapidly; within two years they transformed themselves into the National Fascist Party at a congress in Rome. In 1921, Mussolini won election to the Chamber of Deputies for the first time.[4] In the meantime, from about 1911 until 1938, Mussolini had various affairs with the Jewish author and academic Margherita Sarfatti, called the ""Jewish Mother of Fascism"" at the time.[76]', ""In the night between 27 and 28 October 1922, about 30,000 Fascist blackshirts gathered in Rome to demand the resignation of liberal Prime Minister Luigi Facta and the appointment of a new Fascist government. On the morning of 28 October, King Victor Emmanuel III, who according to the Albertine Statute held the supreme military power, refused the government request to declare martial law, which led to Facta's resignation. The King then handed over power to Mussolini (who stayed in his headquarters in Milan during the talks) by asking him to form a new government. The King's controversial decision has been explained by historians as a combination of delusions and fears; Mussolini enjoyed wide support in the military and among the industrial and agrarian elites, while the King and the conservative establishment were afraid of a possible civil war and thought they could use Mussolini to restore law and order, but failed to foresee the danger of a totalitarian evolution.[77]"", ""As Prime Minister, the first years of Mussolini's rule were characterised by a right-wing coalition government of Fascists, nationalists, liberals, and two Catholic clerics from the People's Party. The Fascists made up a small minority in his original governments. Mussolini's domestic goal was the eventual establishment of a totalitarian state with himself as supreme leader (Il Duce), a message that was articulated by the Fascist newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia, which was now edited by Mussolini's brother, Arnaldo. To that end, Mussolini obtained from the legislature dictatorial powers for one year (legal under the Italian constitution of the time). He favoured the complete restoration of state authority, with the integration of the Italian Fasces of Combat into the armed forces (the foundation in January 1923 of the Voluntary Militia for National Security) and the progressive identification of the party with the state. In political and social economy, he passed legislation that favoured the wealthy industrial and agrarian classes (privatisations, liberalisations of rent laws and dismantlement of the unions).[4]"", 'In 1923, Mussolini sent Italian forces to invade Corfu during the Corfu incident. The League of Nations proved powerless, and Greece was forced to comply with Italian demands.', 'In June 1923, the government passed the Acerbo Law, which transformed Italy into a single national constituency. It also granted a two-thirds majority of the seats in Parliament to the party or group of parties that received at least 25% of the votes.[78] This law applied in the elections of 6 April 1924. The national alliance, consisting of Fascists, most of the old Liberals and others, won 64% of the vote.', ""The assassination of the socialist deputy Giacomo Matteotti, who had requested that the elections be annulled because of the irregularities,[79] provoked a momentary crisis in the Mussolini government. Mussolini ordered a cover-up, but witnesses saw the car that transported Matteotti's body parked outside Matteotti's residence, which linked Amerigo Dumini to the murder."", 'Mussolini later confessed that a few resolute men could have altered public opinion and started a coup that would have swept fascism away. Dumini was imprisoned for two years. On his release, Dumini allegedly told other people that Mussolini was responsible, for which he served further prison time.', 'The opposition parties responded weakly or were generally unresponsive. Many of the socialists, liberals, and moderates boycotted Parliament in the Aventine Secession, hoping to force Victor Emmanuel to dismiss Mussolini.', 'On 31 December 1924, MVSN consuls met with Mussolini and gave him an ultimatum: crush the opposition or they would do so without him. Fearing a revolt by his own militants, Mussolini decided to drop all pretense of democracy.[80] On 3 January 1925, Mussolini made a truculent speech before the Chamber in which he took responsibility for squadristi violence (though he did not mention the assassination of Matteotti).[81] He did not abolish the squadristi until 1927, however.[14]', 'German-American historian Konrad Jarausch has argued that Mussolini was responsible for an integrated suite of political innovations that made fascism a powerful force in Europe. First, he proved the movement could actually seize power and operate a comprehensive government in a major country. Second, the movement claimed to represent the entire national community, not a fragment such as the working class or the aristocracy. He made a significant effort to include the previously alienated Catholic element. He defined public roles for the main sectors of the business community rather than allowing it to operate backstage. Third, he developed a cult of one-man leadership that focused media attention and national debate on his own personality. As a former journalist, Mussolini proved highly adept at exploiting all forms of mass media. Fourth, he created a mass membership party with groups that could be more readily mobilised and monitored. Like all dictators he made liberal use of the threat of extrajudicial violence, as well as actual violence by his Blackshirts, to frighten his opposition.[82]', 'Between 1925 and 1927, Mussolini progressively dismantled virtually all constitutional and conventional restraints on his power and built a police state. A law passed on 24 December 1925—Christmas Eve for the largely Roman Catholic country—changed Mussolini\'s formal title from ""President of the Council of Ministers"" to ""Head of the Government"", although he was still called ""Prime Minister"" by most non-Italian news sources. He was no longer responsible to Parliament and could be removed only by the King. While the Italian constitution stated that ministers were responsible only to the sovereign, in practice it had become all but impossible to govern against the express will of Parliament. The Christmas Eve law ended this practice, and also made Mussolini the only person competent to determine the body\'s agenda. This law transformed Mussolini\'s government into a de facto legal dictatorship. Local autonomy was abolished, and podestàs appointed by the Italian Senate replaced elected mayors and councils.', 'While Italy occupied former Austro-Hungarian areas between years 1918 and 1920, five hundred ""Slav"" societies (for example Sokol) and slightly smaller number of libraries (""reading rooms"") had been forbidden, specifically so later with the Law on Associations (1925), the Law on Public Demonstrations (1926) and the Law on Public Order (1926)—the closure of the classical lyceum in Pisino, of the high school in Voloska (1918), and the five hundred Slovene and Croatian primary schools followed.[83] One thousand ""Slav"" teachers were forcibly exiled to Sardinia and to Southern Italy.', ""On 7 April 1926, Mussolini survived a first assassination attempt by Violet Gibson.[84] On 31 October 1926, 15-year-old Anteo Zamboni attempted to shoot Mussolini in Bologna. Zamboni was lynched on the spot.[85][86] Mussolini also survived a failed assassination attempt in Rome by anarchist Gino Lucetti,[87] and a planned attempt by the Italian anarchist Michele Schirru,[88] which ended with Schirru's capture and execution.[89]"", 'All other parties were outlawed following Zamboni\'s assassination attempt in 1926, though in practice Italy had been a one-party state since 1925. In 1928, an electoral law abolished parliamentary elections. Instead, the Grand Council of Fascism selected a single list of candidates to be approved by plebiscite. If voters rejected the list, the process would simply be repeated until it was approved. The Grand Council had been created five years earlier as a party body but was ""constitutionalized"" and became the highest constitutional authority in the state. On paper, the Grand Council had the power to recommend Mussolini\'s removal from office, and was thus theoretically the only check on his power. However, only Mussolini could summon the Grand Council and determine its agenda. To gain control of the South, especially Sicily, he appointed Cesare Mori as a Prefect of the city of Palermo, with the charge of eradicating the Sicilian Mafia. In the telegram, Mussolini wrote to Mori:', 'Your Excellency has carte blanche; the authority of the State must absolutely, I repeat absolutely, be re-established in Sicily. If the laws still in force hinder you, this will be no problem, as we will draw up new laws.[90]', 'Mori did not hesitate to lay siege to towns, using torture, and holding women and children as hostages to oblige suspects to give themselves up. These harsh methods earned him the nickname of ""Iron Prefect"". In 1927, Mori\'s inquiries brought evidence of collusion between the Mafia and the Fascist establishment, and he was dismissed for length of service in 1929, at which time the number of murders in Palermo Province had decreased from 200 to 23. Mussolini nominated Mori as a senator, and fascist propaganda claimed that the Mafia had been defeated.[91]', 'In accordance with the new electoral law, the general elections took the form of a plebiscite in which voters were presented with a single PNF-dominated list. According to official figures, the list was approved by 98.43% of voters.[92]', 'In 1919, the Italian state had brought in a series of liberal reforms in Libya that allowed education in Arabic and Berber and allowed for the possibility that the Libyans might become Italian citizens.[93] Giuseppe Volpi, who had been appointed governor in 1921, was retained by Mussolini, and withdrew all of the measures offering equality to the Libyans.[93] A policy of confiscating land from the Libyans and granting it to Italian colonists gave new vigor to Libyan resistance led by Omar Mukhtar, and during the ensuing ""Pacification of Libya"", the Fascist regime waged a genocidal campaign designed to kill as many Libyans as possible.[94][93] Well over half the population of Cyrenaica were confined to 15 concentration camps by 1931 while the Royal Italian Air Force staged chemical warfare attacks against the Bedouin.[95] On 20 June 1930, Marshal Pietro Badoglio wrote to General Rodolfo Graziani: ', 'As for overall strategy, it is necessary to create a significant and clear separation between the controlled population and the rebel formations. I do not hide the significance and seriousness of this measure, which might be the ruin of the subdued population ... But now the course has been set, and we must carry it out to the end, even if the entire population of Cyrenaica must perish.[96]', 'On 3 January 1933, Mussolini told the diplomat Baron Pompei Aloisi that the French in Tunisia had made an ""appalling blunder"" by permitting sex between the French and the Tunisians, which he predicted would lead to the French degenerating into a nation of ""half-castes"", and to prevent the same thing happening to the Italians gave orders to Marshal Badoglio that miscegenation be made a crime in Libya.[97]', 'Mussolini launched several public construction programs and government initiatives throughout Italy to combat economic setbacks or unemployment levels. His earliest (and one of the best known) was the Battle for Wheat, by which 5,000 new farms were established and five new agricultural towns (among them Littoria and Sabaudia) on land reclaimed by draining the Pontine Marshes. In Sardinia, a model agricultural town was founded and named Mussolinia (it has long since been renamed Arborea). This town was the first of what Mussolini hoped would be thousands of new agricultural settlements across the country. The Battle for Wheat diverted valuable resources to wheat production from other more economically viable crops. Landowners grew wheat on unsuitable soil using all the advances of modern science, and although the wheat harvest increased, prices rose, consumption fell and high tariffs were imposed.[98] The tariffs promoted widespread inefficiencies and the government subsidies given to farmers pushed the country further into debt.', 'Mussolini also initiated the ""Battle for Land"", a policy based on land reclamation outlined in 1928. The initiative had a mixed success; while projects such as the draining of the Pontine Marsh in 1935 for agriculture were good for propaganda purposes, provided work for the unemployed and allowed for great land owners to control subsidies, other areas in the Battle for Land were not very successful. This program was inconsistent with the Battle for Wheat (small plots of land were inappropriately allocated for large-scale wheat production), and the Pontine Marsh was lost during World War II. Fewer than 10,000 peasants resettled on the redistributed land, and peasant poverty remained high. The Battle for Land initiative was abandoned in 1940.', 'In 1930, in ""The Doctrine of Fascism"" he wrote, ""The so-called crisis can only be settled by State action and within the orbit of the State.""[99] He tried to combat economic recession by introducing a ""Gold for the Fatherland"" initiative, encouraging the public to voluntarily donate gold jewellery to government officials in exchange for steel wristbands bearing the words ""Gold for the Fatherland"". The collected gold was melted down and turned into gold bars, which were then distributed to the national banks.', ""Government control of business was part of Mussolini's policy planning. By 1935, he claimed that three-quarters of Italian businesses were under state control. Later that year, Mussolini issued several edicts to further control the economy, e.g. forcing banks, businesses, and private citizens to surrender all foreign-issued stock and bond holdings to the Bank of Italy. In 1936, he imposed price controls.[100] He also attempted to turn Italy into a self-sufficient autarky, instituting high barriers on trade with most countries except Germany."", 'In 1943, Mussolini proposed the theory of economic socialisation.', 'Mussolini was keen to take the credit for major public works in Italy, particularly the railway system.[101] His reported overhauling of the railway network led to the popular saying, ""Say what you like about Mussolini, he made the trains run on time.""[101] Kenneth Roberts, journalist and novelist, wrote in 1924:', 'The difference between the Italian railway service in 1919, 1920 and 1921 and that which obtained during the first year of the Mussolini regime was almost beyond belief. The cars were clean, the employees were snappy and courteous, and trains arrived at and left the stations on time — not fifteen minutes late, and not five minutes late; but on the minute.[102]', ""In fact, the improvement in Italy's dire post-war railway system had begun before Mussolini took power.[101][103] The improvement was also more apparent than real. Bergen Evans wrote in 1954:"", ""The author was employed as a courier by the Franco-Belgique Tours Company in the summer of 1930, the height of Mussolini's heyday, when a fascist guard rode on every train, and is willing to make an affidavit to the effect that most Italian trains on which he travelled were not on schedule—or near it. There must be thousands who can support this attestation. It's a trifle, but it's worth nailing down.[104]"", 'George Seldes wrote in 1936 that although the express trains carrying tourists generally—though not always—ran on schedule, the same was not true for the smaller lines, where delays were frequent,[101] while Ruth Ben-Ghiat has said that ""they improved the lines that had a political meaning to them"".[104]', 'Mussolini\'s foremost priority was the subjugation of the minds of the Italian people through the use of propaganda. The regime promoted a lavish cult of personality centered on the figure of Mussolini. He pretended to incarnate the new fascist Übermensch, promoting an aesthetic of exasperated Machismo that attributed to him quasi-divine capacities.[105] At various times after 1922, Mussolini personally took over the ministries of the interior, foreign affairs, colonies, corporations, defence, and public works. Sometimes he held as many as seven departments simultaneously, as well as the premiership. He was also head of the all-powerful Fascist Party and the armed local fascist militia, the MVSN or ""Blackshirts"", who terrorised incipient resistance in the cities and provinces. He would later form the OVRA, an institutionalised secret police that carried official state support. In this way he succeeded in keeping power in his own hands and preventing the emergence of any rival.', 'All teachers in schools and universities had to swear an oath to defend the fascist regime. Newspaper editors were all personally chosen by Mussolini, and only those in possession of a certificate of approval from the Fascist Party could practice journalism. These certificates were issued in secret; Mussolini thus skilfully created the illusion of a ""free press"". The trade unions were also deprived of any independence and were integrated into what was called the ""corporative"" system. The aim was to place all Italians in various professional organisations or corporations, all under clandestine governmental control.', ""Large sums of money were spent on highly visible public works and on international prestige projects. These included as the Blue Riband ocean liner SS Rex; setting aeronautical records with the world's fastest seaplane, the Macchi M.C.72; and the transatlantic flying boat cruise of Italo Balbo, which was greeted with much fanfare in the United States when it landed in Chicago in 1933."", 'The principles of the doctrine of Fascism were laid down in an article by eminent philosopher Giovanni Gentile and Mussolini himself that appeared in 1932 in the Enciclopedia Italiana. Mussolini always portrayed himself as an intellectual, and some historians agree.[106] Gunther called him ""easily the best educated and most sophisticated of the dictators"", and the only national leader of 1940 who was an intellectual.[14] German historian Ernst Nolte said that ""His command of contemporary philosophy and political literature was at least as great as that of any other contemporary European political leader.""[107]', 'Nationalists in the years after World War I thought of themselves as combating the liberal and domineering institutions created by cabinets—such as those of Giovanni Giolitti, including traditional schooling. Futurism, a revolutionary cultural movement which would serve as a catalyst for Fascism, argued for ""a school for physical courage and patriotism"", as expressed by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti in 1919. Marinetti expressed his disdain for ""the by now prehistoric and troglodyte Ancient Greek and Latin courses"", arguing for their replacement with exercise modelled on those of the Arditi soldiers. It was in those years that the first Fascist youth wings were formed: Avanguardia Giovanile Fascista (Fascist Youth Vanguards) in 1919, and Gruppi Universitari Fascisti (Fascist University Groups) in 1922.', 'After the March on Rome that brought Mussolini to power, the Fascists started considering ways to politicise Italian society, with an accent on education. Mussolini assigned former ardito and deputy-secretary for Education Renato Ricci the task of ""reorganizing the youth from a moral and physical point of view."" The Opera Nazionale Balilla was created through Mussolini\'s decree of 3 April 1926, and was led by Ricci for the following eleven years. It included children between the ages of 8 and 18, grouped as the Balilla and the Avanguardisti.', 'According to Mussolini: ""Fascist education is moral, physical, social, and military: it aims to create a complete and harmoniously developed human, a fascist one according to our views"". The ""educational value set through action and example"" was to replace the established approaches. Fascism opposed its version of idealism to prevalent rationalism, and used the Opera Nazionale Balilla to circumvent educational tradition by imposing the collective and hierarchy, as well as Mussolini\'s own personality cult.', 'Another important constituent of the Fascist cultural policy was Catholicism. In 1929, a concordat with the Vatican was signed, ending decades of struggle between the Italian state and the papacy that dated back to the 1870 takeover of the Papal States by the House of Savoy during the unification of Italy. The Lateran Treaty, by which the Italian state was at last recognised by the Catholic Church, and the independence of Vatican City was recognised by the Italian state, were so much appreciated by the ecclesiastic hierarchy that Pope Pius XI acclaimed Mussolini as ""the Man of Providence"".[108]', 'The 1929 treaty included a legal provision whereby the Italian government would protect the honour and dignity of the Pope by prosecuting offenders.[109] Mussolini had had his children baptised in 1923 and himself re-baptised by a Catholic priest in 1927.[110] After 1929, Mussolini, with his anti-communist doctrines, convinced many Catholics to actively support him.', 'In foreign policy, Mussolini was pragmatic and opportunistic. His vision centered on forging a new Roman Empire in Africa and the Balkans, vindicating the so-called ""mutilated victory"" of 1918 imposed by Britain and France, which betrayed the Treaty of London and denied Italy its ""natural right"" to supremacy in the Mediterranean.[111][112] However, in the 1920s, given Germany\'s weakness, post-war reconstruction, and reparations issues, Europe\'s situation was unfavorable for openly revising the Treaty of Versailles. Italy\'s foreign policy focused on maintaining an ""equidistant"" stance from major powers to exercise ""determinant weight,"" using alignment with one power to secure support for Italian ambitions in Europe and Africa.[113] Mussolini believed that Italy\'s population, then at 40 million, was insufficient for a major war, and sought to increase it to at least 60 million through relentless natalist policies, including making advocacy of contraception a criminal offense in 1924.[114][115]', ""Initially, Mussolini operated as a pragmatic statesman, seeking advantages without risking war with Britain and France. An exception was the 1923 Corfu incident, where Mussolini was prepared for war with Britain over the assassination of Italian military personnel, but was persuaded to accept a diplomatic solution by the Italian Navy's leadership.[116] In 1925, Mussolini secretly told Italian military leaders that Italy needed to win spazio vitale, aiming to unite the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean under Italian control, though he acknowledged that Italy lacked sufficient manpower for war until the mid-1930s.[116] Mussolini participated in the Locarno Treaties of 1925, which guaranteed Germany's western borders. In 1929, he began planning for aggression against France and Yugoslavia, and by 1932 sought an anti-French alliance with Germany.[116] A planned attack on France and Yugoslavia in 1933 was aborted when Mussolini learned that French intelligence had broken Italian military codes.[116] After Adolf Hitler rose to power, threatening Italian interests in Austria and the Danube basin, Mussolini proposed the Four Power Pact with Britain, France, and Germany in 1933. Italy also signed the Italo-Soviet Pact[117] which was partly intended as a warning to Germany.[118] When Austrian Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss was assassinated in 1934 by Austrian Nazis during a coup, Mussolini threatened Hitler with war in the event of a German invasion of Austria, and opposed any German attempt at Anschluss, promoting the Stresa Front against Germany in 1935."", 'Despite earlier opposition to the Italo-Turkish War, after the Abyssinia Crisis of 1935–1936, Mussolini invaded Ethiopia following border incidents between Ethiopia and Italian Somaliland. Historians are divided on the reasons for the invasion. Some argue it was a distraction from the Great Depression, while others see it as part of a broader expansionist program.[120] Italy’s forces quickly overwhelmed Ethiopia, leading to the proclamation of an Italian Empire in May 1936.[121] Confident of French support due to his opposition to Hitler, Mussolini dismissed the League of Nations\' sanctions imposed over the Ethiopian invasion. He viewed the sanctions as hypocritical attempts by older imperial powers to block Italy’s expansion.[122][123] Italy was criticized for its use of mustard gas and brutal tactics against Ethiopian guerrillas.[121][124] Mussolini ordered systematic terror against Ethiopian rebels, targeting both combatants and civilians.[125][126] Mussolini ordered the execution of the entire adult male population in a town and in one district ordered that ""the prisoners, their accomplices and the uncertain will have to be executed"" as part of the ""gradual liquidation"" of the population.[125] Mussolini favoured a policy of brutality partly because he believed the Ethiopians were not a nation because black people were too stupid to have a sense of nationality.[126] The other reason was because Mussolini was planning on bringing millions of Italians into Ethiopia and wanted to kill off much of the population to make room.[126]', 'Sanctions against Italy pushed Mussolini towards an alliance with Germany. In 1936, he told the German Ambassador that Italy had no objections to Austria becoming a German satellite, removing a key obstacle to Italo-German relations.[127] After the sanctions ended, France and Britain tried to revive the Stresa Front, seeking to retain Italy as an ally. However, in 1936, Mussolini agreed to the Rome-Berlin Axis with Germany, and in 1939 signed the Pact of Steel, binding Italy and Germany in a full military alliance.', ""The conquest of Ethiopia cost 12,000 Italian lives and placed a severe financial burden on Italy. Mussolini had underestimated the cost of the invasion, which proved far higher than expected, and the ongoing occupation further strained Italy’s economy. The Ethiopian and Spanish wars consumed funds intended for military modernization, weakening Italy's military power.[128] From 1936 to 1939, Mussolini provided substantial military support to Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War, further distancing Italy from France and Britain. This intervention and the worsening relationship with the Western powers led Mussolini to accept the German annexation of Austria and the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia. At the Munich Conference in 1938, Mussolini posed as a peacemaker while supporting Germany’s annexation of the Sudetenland."", 'In 1938, TIGR, a Slovene partisan group, plotted to assassinate Mussolini in Kobarid, but their attempt was unsuccessful.', 'By the late 1930s, Mussolini concluded that Britain and France were declining powers, and that Germany and Italy, due to their demographic strength, were destined to rule Europe.[129] He believed that the declining birth rates in France were ""absolutely horrifying"" and that the British Empire was doomed because one-quarter of the British population was over 50.[129] Mussolini preferred an alliance with Germany over Britain and France, viewing it as better to be allied with the strong instead of the weak.[130] He saw international relations as a Social Darwinian struggle between ""virile"" nations with high birth rates destined to destroy ""effete"" nations with low birth rates. Mussolini had no interest in an alliance with France, which he considered a ""weak and old"" nation due to its declining birthrate.[131]', ""Mussolini's belief in Italy's destino to rule the Mediterranean led him to neglect serious planning for a war with the Western powers.[132] He was held back from full alignment with Berlin by Italy's economic and military unpreparedness and his desire to use the Easter Accords of April 1938 to split Britain from France.[133] A military alliance with Germany, rather than the looser political alliance under the Anti-Comintern Pact, would end any chance of Britain implementing the Easter Accords.[134] The Easter Accords were intended by Mussolini to allow Italy to take on France alone, with the hope that improved Anglo-Italian relations would keep Britain neutral in a Franco-Italian war (Mussolini had designs on Tunisia and some support in that country).[134] Britain, in turn, hoped the Easter Accords would win Italy away from Germany."", 'Count Galeazzo Ciano, Mussolini\'s son-in-law and foreign minister, summed up the dictator\'s objectives regarding France in his diary on 8 November 1938: Djibouti would be ruled jointly with France; Tunisia with a similar regime; and Corsica under Italian control.[135] Mussolini showed no interest in Savoy, considering it neither ""historically nor geographically Italian."" On 30 November 1938, Mussolini provoked the French by orchestrating demonstrations where deputies demanded France turn over Tunisia, Savoy, and Corsica to Italy.[136] This led to heightened tensions, with France and Italy on the verge of war through the winter of 1938–39.[137]', 'In January 1939, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain visited Rome. Mussolini learned that while Britain wanted better relations with Italy, it would not sever ties with France.[138] This realization led Mussolini to grow more interested in the German offer of a military alliance, first made in May 1938.[138] In February 1939, Mussolini declared that a state\'s power is ""proportional to its maritime position,"" asserting that Italy was a ""prisoner in the Mediterranean,"" surrounded by British-controlled territories.[139]', 'The new pro-German course was controversial. On 21 March 1939, during a meeting of the Fascist Grand Council, Italo Balbo accused Mussolini of ""licking Hitler\'s boots"" and criticized the pro-German policy as leading Italy to disaster.[140] Despite some internal opposition, Mussolini\'s control of foreign policy ensured that dissenting voices had little impact.[140] In April 1939, Mussolini ordered the Italian invasion of Albania, quickly occupying the country and forcing King Zog I to flee.[141] In May 1939, Mussolini signed the Pact of Steel, a full military alliance with Germany, after securing a promise from Hitler that there would be no war for three years.', ""Despite the pact, Mussolini was cautious. When Hitler expressed his intent to invade Poland, Ciano warned that this would likely lead to war with the Allies. Hitler dismissed the warning, suggesting Italy should invade Yugoslavia.[142] Although tempted, Mussolini knew that Italy was unprepared for a global conflict, particularly given King Victor Emmanuel III's demand for neutrality.[142] Thus, when World War II began with Germany’s invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939, Italy remained uninvolved.[142] However, when the Germans arrested 183 professors from Jagiellonian University in Kraków in November 1939, Mussolini intervened personally, resulting in the release of 101 Poles.[143]"", 'As World War II began, Ciano and Viscount Halifax were holding secret phone conversations. The British wanted Italy on their side against Germany as it had been in World War I.[142] French government opinion was more geared towards action against Italy, as they were eager to attack Italy in Libya. In September 1939, France swung to the opposite extreme, offering to discuss issues with Italy, but as the French were unwilling to discuss Corsica, Nice and Savoy, Mussolini did not answer.[142] Mussolini\'s Under-Secretary for War Production, Carlo Favagrossa, had estimated that Italy could not be prepared for major military operations until 1942 due to its relatively weak industrial sector compared to western Europe.[144] In late November 1939, Adolf Hitler declared: ""So long as the Duce lives, one can rest assured that Italy will seize every opportunity to achieve its imperialistic aims.""[142]', 'Convinced that the war would soon be over, with a German victory looking likely at that point, Mussolini decided to enter the war on the Axis side. Accordingly, Italy declared war on Britain and France on 10 June 1940. Mussolini regarded the war against Britain and France as a life-or-death struggle between opposing ideologies—fascism and the ""plutocratic and reactionary democracies of the west""—describing the war as ""the struggle of the fertile and young people against the sterile people moving to the sunset; it is the struggle between two centuries and two ideas"".[145]', 'Italy joined the Germans in the Battle of France, fighting the fortified Alpine Line at the border. Just eleven days later, France and Germany signed an armistice. Included in Italian-controlled France were most of Nice and other southeastern counties.[146] Mussolini planned to concentrate Italian forces on a major offensive against the British Empire in Africa and the Middle East, known as the ""parallel war"", while expecting the collapse of the UK in the European theatre. The Italians invaded Egypt, bombed Mandatory Palestine, and attacked the British in their Sudan, Kenya and British Somaliland colonies (in what would become known as the East African Campaign);[147] British Somaliland was conquered and became part of Italian East Africa on 3 August 1940, and there were Italian advances in the Sudan and Kenya with initial success.[148] The British government refused to accept proposals for a peace that would involve accepting Axis victories in Europe; plans for an invasion of the UK did not proceed and the war continued.', 'In September 1940, the Italian Tenth Army was commanded by Marshal Rodolfo Graziani and crossed from Italian Libya into Egypt, where British forces were located; this would become the Western Desert Campaign. Advances were successful, but the Italians stopped at Sidi Barrani waiting for logistic supplies to catch up. On 24 October 1940, Mussolini sent the Italian Air Corps to Belgium, where it took part in the Blitz until January 1941.[149] In October, Mussolini also sent Italian forces into Greece, starting the Greco-Italian War. The Royal Air Force prevented the Italian invasion and allowed the Greeks to push the Italians back to Albania, but the Greek counter-offensive in Italian Albania ended in a stalemate.[150]', 'Events in Africa had changed by early 1941 as Operation Compass had forced the Italians back into Libya, causing high losses in the Italian Army.[151] Also in the East African Campaign, an attack was mounted against Italian forces. Despite putting up some stiff resistance, they were overwhelmed at the Battle of Keren, and the Italian defence started to crumble with a final defeat in the Battle of Gondar. When addressing the Italian public on the events, Mussolini was open about the situation, saying ""We call bread bread and wine wine, and when the enemy wins a battle it is useless and ridiculous to seek, as the English do in their incomparable hypocrisy, to deny or diminish it.""[152] With the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia and Greece, Italy annexed Ljubljana, Dalmatia and Montenegro, and established the puppet states of Croatia and the Hellenic State.', 'General Mario Robotti, Commander of the Italian XI Corps in Slovenia and Croatia, issued an order in line with a directive received from Mussolini in June 1942: ""I would not be opposed to all (sic) Slovenes being imprisoned and replaced by Italians. In other words, we should take steps to ensure that political and ethnic frontiers coincide"".[153]', ""Mussolini first learned of Operation Barbarossa after the invasion of the Soviet Union had begun on 22 June 1941, and was not asked by Hitler to involve himself.[154] On 25 June 1941, he inspected the first units at Verona, which served as his launching pad to Russia.[155] Mussolini told the Council of Ministers of 5 July that his only worry was that Germany might defeat the Soviet Union before the Italians arrived.[156] At a meeting with Hitler in August, Mussolini offered and Hitler accepted the commitment of further Italian troops to fight the Soviet Union.[157] The heavy losses suffered by the Italians on the Eastern Front, where service was extremely unpopular owing to the widespread view that this was not Italy's fight, did much to damage Mussolini's prestige with the Italian people.[157] After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, he declared war on the United States on 11 December 1941.[158][159] A piece of evidence regarding Mussolini's response to the attack on Pearl Harbor comes from the diary of his Foreign Minister Ciano:"", 'A night telephone call from Ribbentrop. He is overjoyed about the Japanese attack on America. He is so happy about it that I am happy with him, though I am not too sure about the final advantages of what has happened. One thing is now certain, that America will enter the conflict and that the conflict will be so long that she will be able to realize all her potential forces. This morning I told this to the King who had been pleased about the event. He ended by admitting that, in the long run, I may be right. Mussolini was happy, too. For a long time he has favored a definite clarification of relations between America and the Axis.[160]', ""Italian forces had also achieved some victories suppressing partisan activities in Yugoslavia, Greece, Albania and in Montenegro. In North Africa. Italian forces would drive the British forces out of Libya during the Battle of Gazala and pushed towards to Egypt with the aim of capturing Alexandria and the Suez Canal, but the offensive was halted at El Alamein in summer of 1942. On October 1942, the Second Battle of El Alamein began. Italian forces was severly defeated by the British and Commonwealth forces and got driven out of Egypt, the British and Commonwealth forces would drive the Italians until January 1943 when the capital of the Italian Libya, Tripoli fell into the Allies. Following Vichy France's collapse and the Case Anton on November 1942, Italy occupied the French territories of Corsica and Tunisia. Italian forces would use Tunisia as a base of military operations for the Tunisian campaign."", 'Although Mussolini was aware that Italy, whose resources were reduced by the campaigns of the 1930s, was not ready for a long war, he opted to remain in the conflict to not abandon the occupied territories and the fascist imperial ambitions.[161]', ""By 1943, Italy's military position had become untenable. Axis forces in North Africa were defeated in the Tunisian Campaign in early 1943. Italy suffered major setbacks on the Eastern Front and in the Allied invasion of Sicily.[162] The Italian home front was also in bad shape as the Allied bombings were taking their toll. Factories all over Italy were brought to a virtual standstill because raw materials were lacking. There was a chronic shortage of food, and what food was available was being sold at nearly confiscatory prices. Mussolini's once-ubiquitous propaganda machine lost its grip on the people; a large number of Italians turned to Vatican Radio or Radio London for more accurate news coverage. Discontent came to a head in March 1943 with a wave of labour strikes in the industrial north—the first large-scale strikes since 1925.[163] Also in March, some of the major factories in Milan and Turin stopped production to secure evacuation allowances for workers' families. The German presence in Italy had sharply turned public opinion against Mussolini; when the Allies invaded Sicily, the majority of the public there welcomed them as liberators.[164]"", ""Mussolini feared that with Allied victory in North Africa, Allied armies would come across the Mediterranean and attack Italy. In April 1943, as the Allies closed into Tunisia, Mussolini had urged Hitler to make a separate peace with the USSR and send German troops to the west to guard against an expected Allied invasion of Italy. The Allies landed in Sicily on 10 July 1943, and within a few days it was obvious the Italian army was on the brink of collapse. This led Hitler to summon Mussolini to a meeting in Feltre on 19 July 1943. By this time, Mussolini was so shaken from stress that he could no longer stand Hitler's boasting. His mood darkened further when that same day, the Allies bombed Rome—the first time that city had ever been the target of enemy bombing.[165] It was obvious by this time that the war was lost, but Mussolini could not extricate himself from the German alliance.[166]By this point, some prominent members of Mussolini's government had turned against him, including Grandi and Ciano. Several of his colleagues were close to revolt, and Mussolini was forced to summon the Grand Council on 24 July 1943. This was the first time the body had met since the start of the war. When he announced that the Germans were thinking of evacuating the south, Grandi launched a blistering attack on him.[162] Grandi moved a resolution asking the king to resume his full constitutional powers—in effect, a vote of no confidence in Mussolini. This motion carried by a 19–8 margin.[163] Mussolini showed little visible reaction, even though this effectively authorised the king to sack him. He did, however, ask Grandi to consider the possibility that this motion would spell the end of Fascism. The vote, although significant, had no de jure effect, since in a Constitutional Monarchy the prime minister was only responsible to the king and only the king could dismiss the prime minister.[166]"", ""Despite this sharp rebuke, Mussolini showed up for work the next day as usual. He allegedly viewed the Grand Council as merely an advisory body and did not think the vote would have any substantive effect.[163] That afternoon, at 17:00, he was summoned to the royal palace by Victor Emmanuel. By then, Victor Emmanuel had already decided to sack him; the king had arranged an escort for Mussolini and had the government building surrounded by 200 carabinieri. Mussolini was unaware of these moves by the king and tried to tell him about the Grand Council meeting. Victor Emmanuel cut him off and formally dismissed him from office, although guaranteeing his immunity.[163] After Mussolini left the palace, he was arrested by the carabinieri on the king's orders without telling him that he was formally arrested but rather under protective custody, as Victor Emmanuel III was trying to save the monarchy. The police took Mussolini in a Red Cross ambulance car, without specifying his destination and assuring him that they were doing it for his own safety.[167] By this time, discontent with Mussolini was so intense that when the news of his downfall was announced on the radio, there was no resistance of any sort. People rejoiced because they believed that the end of Mussolini also meant the end of the war.[163] The king appointed Marshal Pietro Badoglio as the prime minister."", 'In an effort to conceal his location from the Germans, Mussolini was moved around: first to Ponza, then to La Maddalena, before being imprisoned at Campo Imperatore, a mountain resort in Abruzzo where he was completely isolated. Badoglio kept up the appearance of loyalty to Germany, and announced that Italy would continue fighting on the side of the Axis. However, he dissolved the Fascist Party two days after taking over and began negotiating with the Allies. On 3 September 1943, Badoglio agreed to an Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces. Its announcement five days later threw Italy into chaos; German troops seized control in Operation Achse. As the Germans approached Rome, Badoglio and the king fled with their main collaborators to Apulia, putting themselves under the protection of the Allies, but leaving the Italian Army without orders.[168] After a period of anarchy, they formed a government in Malta, and finally declared war on Germany on 13 October 1943. Several thousand Italian troops joined the Allies to fight against the Germans; most others deserted or surrendered to the Germans; some refused to switch sides and joined the Germans. The Badoglio government agreed to a political truce with the predominantly leftist Partisans for the sake of Italy and to rid the land of the Nazis.[169]', ""Only two months after Mussolini had been dismissed and arrested, he was rescued from his prison at the Hotel Campo Imperatore in the Gran Sasso raid on 12 September 1943 by a special Fallschirmjäger (paratroopers) unit and Waffen-SS commandos led by Major Otto-Harald Mors; Otto Skorzeny was also present.[167] The rescue saved Mussolini from being turned over to the Allies in accordance with the armistice.[169] Hitler had made plans to arrest the king, the Crown Prince Umberto, Badoglio, and the rest of the government and restore Mussolini to power in Rome, but the government's escape south likely foiled those plans.[165]"", ""Three days after his rescue in the Gran Sasso raid, Mussolini was taken to Germany for a meeting with Hitler in Rastenburg at his East Prussian headquarters. Despite his public support, Hitler was clearly shocked by Mussolini's dishevelled and haggard appearance as well as his unwillingness to go after the men in Rome who overthrew him. Feeling that he had to do what he could to blunt the edges of Nazi repression, Mussolini agreed to set up a new regime, the Italian Social Republic (Italian: Repubblica Sociale Italiana, RSI),[162] informally known as the Salò Republic because of its seat in the town of Salò, where he was settled 11 days after his rescue by the Germans. His new regime was much reduced in territory; in addition to losing the Italian lands held by the Allies and Badoglio's government, the provinces of Bolzano, Belluno and Trento were placed under German administration in the Operational Zone of the Alpine Foothills, while the provinces of Udine, Gorizia, Trieste, Pola (now Pula), Fiume (now Rijeka), and Ljubljana (Lubiana in Italian) were incorporated into the German Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral.[170][171]"", ""Additionally, German forces occupied the Dalmatian provinces of Split (Spalato) and Kotor (Cattaro), which were subsequently annexed by the Croatian fascist regime. Italy's conquests in Greece and Albania were also lost to Germany, with the exception of the Italian Islands of the Aegean, which remained nominally under RSI rule.[172] Mussolini opposed any territorial reductions of the Italian state and told his associates:"", 'I am not here to renounce even a square meter of state territory. We will go back to war for this. And we will rebel against anyone for this. Where the Italian flag flew, the Italian flag will return. And where it has not been lowered, now that I am here, no one will have it lowered. I have said these things to the Führer.[173]', 'For about a year and a half, Mussolini lived in Gargnano on Lake Garda in Lombardy. Although he insisted in public that he was in full control, he knew he was a puppet ruler under the protection of his German liberators—for all intents and purposes, the Gauleiter of Lombardy.[165] Indeed, he lived under what amounted to house arrest by the SS, who restricted his communications and travel. He told one of his colleagues that being sent to a concentration camp would be preferable.[166]', 'Yielding to pressure from Hitler and the remaining loyal fascists who formed the government of the Republic of Salò, Mussolini helped orchestrate executions of some of the leaders who had betrayed him at the last meeting of the Fascist Grand Council. One of those executed was his son-in-law, Galeazzo Ciano. As head of state and Minister of Foreign Affairs for the Italian Social Republic, Mussolini used much of his time to write his memoirs. Along with his autobiographical writings of 1928, these writings would be combined and published by Da Capo Press as My Rise and Fall. In an interview in January 1945 by Madeleine Mollier, a few months before he was captured and executed, he stated flatly: ""Seven years ago, I was an interesting person. Now, I am little more than a corpse."" He continued:', 'Yes, madam, I am finished. My star has fallen. I have no fight left in me. I work and I try, yet know that all is but a farce... I await the end of the tragedy and—strangely detached from everything—I do not feel any more an actor. I feel I am the last of spectators.[174]', ""On 25 April 1945, Allied troops were advancing into northern Italy, and the collapse of the Salò Republic was imminent. Mussolini and his mistress Clara Petacci set out for Switzerland,[175] intending to board a plane and escape to Spain.[176] Two days later on 27 April, they were stopped near the village of Dongo (Lake Como) by communist partisans named Valerio and Bellini and identified by the Political Commissar of the partisans' 52nd Garibaldi Brigade, Urbano Lazzaro. Petacci's brother posed as a Spanish consul.[177] The assets on Mussolini's convoy at the time of his capture became known as the Dongo Treasure.[178]"", 'With the spread of the news of the arrest, several telegrams arrived at the command of the National Liberation Committee for Northern Italy from the Office of Strategic Services headquarters in Siena with the request that Mussolini be entrusted to Allied forces.[179] In fact, clause number 29 of the armistice signed in Malta by Eisenhower and the Marshal of Italy Pietro Badoglio on 29 September 1943, expressly provided that: ', 'Benito Mussolini, his main fascist associates and all persons suspected of having committed crimes of war or similar crimes, whose names are on the lists that will be delivered by the United Nations and which now or in the future are in territory controlled by the allied military command or by the Italian government, will be immediately arrested and handed over to the United Nations forces.[180]', 'The next day, Mussolini and Petacci were both summarily shot, along with most of the members of their 15-man train, primarily ministers and officials of the Italian Social Republic. The shootings took place in the small village of Giulino di Mezzegra and were conducted by a partisan leader with the nom de guerre Colonnello Valerio. His real identity is unknown, but conventionally he is thought to have been Walter Audisio, who always claimed to have carried out the execution, though another partisan controversially alleged that Colonnello Valerio was Luigi Longo, subsequently a leading communist politician.[181][182]', 'On 29 April 1945, the bodies of Mussolini, Petacci, and the other executed fascists were loaded into a van and moved south to Milan. At 3:00\xa0a.m., the corpses were dumped on the ground in the old Piazzale Loreto. The piazza had been renamed ""Piazza Quindici Martiri"" (Fifteen Martyrs\' Square) in honour of fifteen Italian partisans recently executed there.[183]', ""After being kicked and spat upon, the bodies were hung upside down from the roof of a service station[184][185] and stoned from below by civilians. This was done both to discourage any fascists from continuing the fight and as an act of revenge for the hanging of partisans in the same place by Axis authorities. The corpse of the deposed leader was subject to ridicule and abuse. Fascist loyalist Achille Starace was captured and sentenced to death, then taken to the Piazzale Loreto and shown the body of Mussolini, which he saluted just before being shot. His body was strung up beside Mussolini's."", ""Mussolini's first wife was Ida Dalser, whom he married in Trento in 1914. The couple had a son the following year and named him Benito Albino Mussolini. In December 1915, Mussolini married Rachele Guidi, who had been his mistress since 1910. Due to his upcoming political ascendency, the information about his first marriage was suppressed, and both his first wife and son were later persecuted.[58] With Rachele, Mussolini had two daughters, Edda and Anna Maria; and three sons: Vittorio, Bruno and Romano. Mussolini had several mistresses, among them Margherita Sarfatti and his final companion, Clara Petacci. Mussolini had many brief sexual encounters with female supporters, as reported by his biographer Nicholas Farrell.[186]"", ""Imprisonment may have been the cause of Mussolini's claustrophobia. He refused to enter the Blue Grotto and preferred large rooms like his 18 by 12 by 12\xa0m (60 by 40 by 40 feet) office at the Palazzo Venezia.[14]"", 'In addition to his native Italian, Mussolini spoke English, French, and sufficient German to dispense with an interpreter. This was notable at the Munich Conference, as no other national leader spoke anything other than his native language; Mussolini was described as effectively being the ""chief interpreter"".[187]', 'Mussolini was raised by a devoutly Catholic mother[188] and an anti-clerical father.[189] His mother Rosa had him baptised into the Roman Catholic Church, and took her children to services every Sunday. His father never attended.[188]Mussolini regarded his time at a religious boarding school as punishment, compared the experience to hell, and ""once refused to go to morning Mass and had to be dragged there by force.""[190]', 'Mussolini became anti-clerical like his father. As a young man, he ""proclaimed himself to be an atheist[191] and several times tried to shock an audience by calling on God to strike him dead.""[189] He believed that science had proven there was no God, and that the historical Jesus was ignorant and mad. He considered religion a disease of the psyche, and accused Christianity of promoting resignation and cowardice.[189] Mussolini is claimed to be superstitious, because after hearing of the curse of the Pharaohs, he ordered the immediate removal of an Egyptian mummy that he had been gifted from the Palazzo Chigi.[14]', 'Mussolini was an admirer of Friedrich Nietzsche. According to Denis Mack Smith, ""In Nietzsche he found justification for his crusade against the Christian virtues of humility, resignation, charity, and goodness.""[192] He valued Nietzsche\'s concept of the superman, ""The supreme egoist who defied both God and the masses, who despised egalitarianism and democracy, who believed in the weakest going to the wall and pushing them if they did not go fast enough.""[192] On his 60th birthday, Mussolini received a gift from Hitler of a complete twenty-four volume set of the works of Nietzsche.[193]', 'Mussolini made vitriolic attacks against Christianity and the Catholic Church, which he accompanied with provocative remarks about the consecrated host, and about a love affair between Christ and Mary Magdalene. He denounced socialists who were tolerant of religion, or who had their children baptised, and called for socialists who accepted religious marriage to be expelled from the party. He denounced the Catholic Church for ""its authoritarianism and refusal to allow freedom of thought\xa0..."" Mussolini\'s newspaper, La Lotta di Classe, reportedly had an anti-Christian editorial stance.[194]', 'Despite making such attacks, Mussolini tried to win popular support by appeasing the Catholic majority in Italy. In 1924, Mussolini saw to it that three of his children were given communion. In 1925, he had a priest perform a religious marriage ceremony for himself and his wife Rachele, whom he had married in a civil ceremony 10 years earlier.[195] On 11 February 1929, he signed a concordat and treaty with the Roman Catholic Church.[196] Under the Lateran Pact, Vatican City was granted independent statehood and placed under Church law—rather than Italian law—and the Catholic religion was recognised as Italy\'s state religion.[197] The Church also regained authority over marriage, Catholicism could be taught in all secondary schools, birth control and freemasonry were banned, and the clergy received subsidies from the state and was exempted from taxation.[198][199] Pope Pius XI praised Mussolini, and the official Catholic newspaper pronounced ""Italy has been given back to God and God to Italy.""[197]', 'After this conciliation, he claimed the Church was subordinate to the State, and ""referred to Catholicism as, in origin, a minor sect that had spread beyond Palestine only because grafted onto the organization of the Roman empire.""[196] After the concordat, ""he confiscated more issues of Catholic newspapers in the next three months than in the previous seven years.""[196] Mussolini reportedly came close to being excommunicated from the Catholic Church around this time.[196]', 'Mussolini publicly reconciled with the Pope Pius XI in 1932, but ""took care to exclude from the newspapers any photography of himself kneeling or showing deference to the Pope.""[196] He wanted to persuade Catholics that ""[f]ascism was Catholic and he himself a believer who spent some of each day in prayer\xa0...""[196] The Pope began referring to Mussolini as ""a man sent by Providence.""[194][196] Despite Mussolini\'s efforts to appear pious, by order of his party, pronouns referring to him ""had to be capitalized like those referring to God\xa0...""[200]', 'In 1938 Mussolini began reasserting his anti-clericalism.

Most historians have generally labeled him as a political opportunist when it came to the treatment of the Jews rather than following a sincere belief. Mussolini considered Italian Jews to be Italians, but this belief may have been influenced more by his anti-clericalism and the general mood of Italy at the time, which denounced the abusive treatment of the Jews in the Roman Ghetto by the Papal States until the Unification of Italy.[208] Although Mussolini had initially disregarded biological racism, he was a firm believer in national traits and made several generalisations about Jews. Mussolini blamed the Russian Revolution of 1917 on ""Jewish vengeance"" against Christianity with the remark ""Race does not betray race ... Bolshevism is being defended by the international plutocracy. That is the real truth."" He also made an assertion that 80% of Soviet leaders were Jewish.[209] Yet, within a few weeks, he contradicted himself with the remark ""Bolshevism is not, as people believe, a Jewish phenomenon. The truth is that Bolshevism is leading to the utter ruin of the Jews of Eastern Europe.""[210]', 'In the early 1920s, Mussolini stated that Fascism would never raise a ""Jewish Question"" and in an article he wrote he stated ""Italy knows no antisemitism and we believe that it will never know it"", and then elaborated, ""let us hope that Italian Jews will continue to be sensible enough so as not to give rise to antisemitism in the only country where it has never existed.""[211] In 1932, Mussolini during a conversation with Emil Ludwig described antisemitism as a ""German vice"" and stated that ""There was \'no Jewish Question\' in Italy and could not be one in a country with a healthy system of government.""[212] On several occasions, Mussolini spoke positively about Jews and the Zionist movement,[213] although Fascism remained suspicious of Zionism after the Fascist Party gained power.[214] In 1934, Mussolini supported the establishment of the Betar Naval Academy in Civitavecchia to train Zionist cadets, arguing that a Jewish state would be in Italy\'s interest.[215]Until 1938 Mussolini had denied any antisemitism within the Fascist Party.[213]', 'The relationship between Mussolini and Adolf Hitler was a contentious one early on. While Hitler cited Mussolini as an influence and privately expressed great admiration for him,[216] Mussolini had little regard for Hitler, especially after the Nazis had his friend and ally, Engelbert Dollfuss, the Austrofascist dictator of Austria, killed in 1934.', 'With the assassination of Dollfuss, Mussolini attempted to distance himself from Hitler by rejecting much of the racialism (particularly Nordicism) and antisemitism espoused by the Nazis. Mussolini during this period rejected biological racism, at least in the Nazi sense, and instead emphasised ""Italianising"" the parts of the Italian Empire he had desired to build.[217] He declared that the ideas of eugenics and the racially charged concept of an Aryan nation were not possible.[217] Mussolini dismissed the idea of a master race as ""arrant nonsense, stupid and idiotic"".[218]', 'When discussing the Nazi decree that the German people must carry a passport with either Aryan or Jewish racial affiliation marked on it, in 1934, Mussolini wondered how they would designate membership in the ""Germanic race"":', ""But which race? Does there exist a German race? Has it ever existed? Will it ever exist? Reality, myth, or hoax of the theorists?Ah well, we respond, a Germanic race does not exist. Various movements. Curiosity. Stupor. We repeat. Does not exist. We don't say so. Scientists say so. Hitler says so.[219]"", 'When German-Jewish journalist Emil Ludwig asked about his views on race in 1933, Mussolini exclaimed:', 'Race! It is a feeling, not a reality: ninety-five percent, at least, is a feeling. Nothing will ever make me believe that biologically pure races can be shown to exist today. Amusingly enough, not one of those who have proclaimed the ""nobility"" of the Teutonic race was himself a Teuton. Gobineau was a Frenchman, (Houston Stewart) Chamberlain, an Englishman; Woltmann, a Jew; Lapouge, another Frenchman.[220][221]', 'In a speech given in Bari in 1934, he reiterated his attitude towards the German ideology of Master race:', 'Thirty centuries of history allow us to look with supreme pity on certain doctrines which are preached beyond the Alps by the descendants of those who were illiterate when Rome had Caesar, Virgil and Augustus.[222][223]', 'Though Italian Fascism varied its official positions on race from the 1920s to 1934, ideologically Italian Fascism did not originally discriminate against the Italian-Jewish community: Mussolini recognised that a small contingent had lived there ""since the days of the Kings of Rome"" and should ""remain undisturbed"".[224] There were even some Jews in the National Fascist Party, such as Ettore Ovazza, who in 1935 founded the Jewish Fascist paper La Nostra Bandiera (""Our Flag"").[225]', 'By mid-1938, the enormous influence Hitler now had over Mussolini became clear with the introduction of the Manifesto of Race. The Manifesto, which was closely modelled on the Nazi Nuremberg Laws,[80] stripped Jews of their Italian citizenship and with it any position in the government or professions. The racial laws declared Italians to be part of the Aryan race and forbade sexual relations and marriages between Italians and those considered to be of an ""inferior race"", chiefly Jews and Africans.[226] Jews were not permitted to own or manage companies involved in military production, or factories that employed over one hundred people or exceeded a certain value. They could not own land over a certain value, serve in the armed forces, employ non-Jewish domestics, or belong to the Fascist party. Their employment in banks, insurance companies, and public schools was forbidden.[227] While many historians have explained Mussolini\'s introduction of the Manifesto of Race as being purely a pragmatic move to gain favour with Italy\'s new ally,[228] others have challenged that viewpoint[229] and pointed out that Mussolini, along with other Fascist officials, had encouraged antisemitic sentiment well before 1938, such as in response to significant Jewish participation in Giustizia e Libertà, a highly prominent anti-Fascist organisation.[230] Proponents of this viewpoint argue that Mussolini\'s implementation of these laws reflected a homegrown Italian flavour of antisemitism distinct from that of Nazism,[231] one which perceived Jews as being bound to decadence and liberalism[232] and was influenced not just by Fascist ideology but also by the Catholic Church.[97]', 'Even after the introduction of the racial laws, Mussolini continued to make contradictory statements about race.[213] Many high government officials told Jewish representatives that the antisemitism in Fascist Italy would soon be over.[213] Antisemitism was unpopular within the Fascist party; once when a Fascist scholar protested to Mussolini about the treatment of his Jewish friends, Mussolini is reported to have said ""I agree with you entirely. I don\'t believe a bit in the stupid antisemitic theory. I am carrying out my policy entirely for political reasons.""[233] Hitler was disappointed with Mussolini\'s perceived lack of antisemitism,[234] as was Joseph Goebbels, who once said that ""Mussolini appears to have not recognized the Jewish question"". Nazi racial theorist Alfred Rosenberg criticised Fascist Italy for its lack of what he defined as a true concept of \'race\' and \'Jewishness\', while the virulently racist Julius Streicher, writing for the unofficial Nazi propaganda newspaper Der Stürmer, dismissed Mussolini as a Jewish puppet and lackey.[235]', ""Mussolini and the Italian Army in occupied regions openly opposed German efforts to deport Italian Jews to Nazi concentration camps.[236] Italy's refusal to comply with German demands of Jewish persecution influenced other countries.[236]"", 'In September 1943 semi-autonomous militarised squads of Fascist fanatics sprouted up throughout the Republic of Salò. These squads spread terror among Jews and partisans for a year and a half. In the power vacuum that existed during the first three or four months of the occupation, the semi-autonomous bands were virtually uncontrollable. Many were linked to individual high-ranking Fascist politicians.[237] Italian Fascists, sometimes government employees but more often fanatic civilians or paramilitary volunteers, hastened to curry favour with the Nazis. Informers betrayed their neighbours, squadristi seized Jews and delivered them to the German SS, and Italian journalists seemed to compete in the virulence of their anti-Semitic diatribes.[238]', ""It has been widely speculated that Mussolini adopted the Manifesto of Race in 1938 for merely tactical reasons, to strengthen Italy's relations with Germany. Mussolini and the Italian military did not consistently apply the laws adopted in the Manifesto of Race.[236] In December 1943, Mussolini made a confession to journalist/politician Bruno Spampanato that seems to indicate that he regretted the Manifesto of Race:"", ""The Racial Manifesto could have been avoided. It dealt with the scientific abstruseness of a few teachers and journalists, a conscientious German essay translated into bad Italian. It is far from what I have said, written and signed on the subject. I suggest that you consult the old issues of Il Popolo d'Italia. For this reason I am far from accepting (Alfred) Rosenberg's myth.[239]"", 'Mussolini also reached out to the Muslims in his empire and in the predominantly Arab countries of the Middle East. In 1937, the Muslims of Libya presented Mussolini with the ""Sword of Islam"" while Fascist propaganda pronounced him as the ""Protector of Islam"".[240]', 'Despite Mussolini\'s ostensible disbelief in biological racism, Fascist Italy implemented numerous laws rooted in such notions throughout its colonial empire on his orders as well as those of lower-ranking Fascist officials.[235] Following the Second Italo-Senussi War, Mussolini directed Marshal Pietro Badoglio to ban miscegenation in Libya, fearing that Italian settlers in the colony would degenerate into ""half-castes"" if interracial relationships were permitted.[97] During the Second Italo-Ethiopian War and the ensuing Italian colonisation of Ethiopia, Mussolini implemented numerous laws mandating strict racial segregation between black Africans and Italians in Italian East Africa. These racist laws were much more rigorous and pervasive than those in other European colonies, comparable in scope and scale to those of South Africa during the Apartheid era. Fascist Italy\'s segregationism further differed from that of other European colonies in that its impetus came not from within its colonies, as was usually the case, but from metropolitan Italy, specifically from Mussolini himself. Though many of these laws were ignored by local officials due to the difficulty of properly enforcing them, Mussolini frequently complained to subordinates upon hearing of instances of them being broken and saw the need to micromanage race relations as part of his ideological vision.[241]', 'Mussolini was survived by his wife, Rachele Mussolini, two sons, Vittorio and Romano Mussolini, and his daughters Edda (the widow of Count Ciano) and Anna Maria. A third son, Bruno, was killed in an air accident while flying a Piaggio P.108 bomber on a test mission, on 7 August 1941.', ""Alessandra Mussolini, granddaughter of Mussolini, is politically active in Italian right circles. She has been a member of the European Parliament for the far-right Social Alternative movement, a deputy in the Italian lower chamber and served in the Senate as a member of Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party. Her stepsister Rachele Mussolini is also active in politics through Brothers of Italy, the main Italian right-wing party; she is the daughter of Romano and his second wife Carla Maria Puccini. Caio Giulio Cesare Mussolini, a great-grandson of Mussolini through his son Vittorio, is also active in politics in Brothers of Italy.[242]"", 'Mussolini inspired and supported the international spread of fascist movements during the inter-war period.[243][244][245][246][247] Although the National Fascist Party was outlawed by the postwar Constitution of Italy, a number of successor neo-fascist parties emerged to carry on its legacy. Historically, the largest neo-fascist party was the Italian Social Movement (Movimento Sociale Italiano), which disbanded in 1995 and was replaced by National Alliance, a conservative party that distanced itself from Fascism (its founder, former foreign minister Gianfranco Fini, declared during an official visit to Israel that Fascism was ""an absolute evil"").[248] National Alliance and a number of neo-fascist parties were merged in 2009 to create the short-lived People of Freedom party led by then Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, which eventually disbanded after the defeat in the 2013 general election. In 2012, many former members of National Alliance joined Brothers of Italy, led by current Prime Minister of Italy, Giorgia Meloni.[249]', 'In February 2018, a poll conducted by the Demos & Pi research institute found that out of the total 1,014 people interviewed, 19% of voters across the Italian political spectrum had a ""positive or very positive"" opinion of Mussolini, 60% saw him negatively and 21% did not have an opinion.[250]']","Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini[a] (29 July 1883 – 28 April 1945) was an Italian dictator who founded and led the National Fascist Party (PNF). He was Prime Minister of Italy from the March on Rome in 1922, until his deposition in 1943, as well as Duce of Italian fascism from the establishment of the Italian Fasces of Combat in 1919, until his summary execution in 1945. As a dictator and founder of fascism, Mussolini inspired the international spread of fascist movements during the interwar period.[1]","The article provides a comprehensive overview of Benito Mussolini's life, ideology, and legacy. Here are some key points:

**Life and Ideology**

* Mussolini was the dictator of Italy from 1922 to 1943.
* He adopted the Manifesto of Race in 1938, which promoted biological racism and anti-Semitism.
* Despite his initial skepticism about the manifesto's scientific basis, Mussolini implemented many laws rooted in racist ideology throughout his colonial empire.

**Racism and Colonial Policy**

* Fascist Italy implemented numerous laws mandating racial segregation between black Africans and Italians in Italian East Africa, similar to those in South Africa during the Apartheid era.
* These laws were more rigorous and pervasive than those in other European colonies, reflecting Mussolini's personal involvement and ideology.

**International Legacy**

* Mussolini inspired and supported the international spread of fascist movements during the inter-war period.
* Neo-fascist parties emerged after World War II, with some groups maintaining ties to Mussolini's legacy. These parties include the Italian Social Movement (MSI), National Alliance, and Brothers of Italy.

**Public Perception**

* A 2018 poll found that 19% of Italian voters had a ""positive or very positive"" opinion of Mussolini, while 60% saw him negatively.
* The poll also showed that 21% did not have an opinion, suggesting that the perception of Mussolini is complex and nuanced.

**Family Legacy**

* Mussolini's family members continue to be involved in politics: Alessandra Mussolini (granddaughter) has been active in right-wing circles, while Rachele Mussolini (step-sister) is also politically active through Brothers of Italy.
* Caio Giulio Cesare Mussolini (great-grandson) is also involved in politics through Brothers of Italy.

Hideki_Tojo,"[""Hideki Tojo (東條 英機, Tōjō Hideki, pronounced [toːʑoː çideki] ⓘ; 30 December 1884\xa0– 23 December 1948) was a Japanese politician and general who served as prime minister of Japan from 1941 to 1944, during World War II. His leadership was marked by widespread state violence perpetrated in the name of Japanese nationalism and imperialism; after the war, he was convicted as a war criminal and executed. Tojo's legacy remains firmly intertwined with the Empire of Japan's wars of aggression and numerous atrocities."", ""Born in Tokyo to a military family, Tojo was educated at the Japanese Military Academy and began his career in the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) in 1905. He served as a military attaché in Germany from 1919 to 1922, and rose through the ranks to become a general in 1934. In 1935, he assumed top command of the Kempeitai attached to the Kwantung Army in Manchuria, and was promoted to the Kwantung Army's chief of staff in 1937, leading military operations against the Chinese in the border regions. In 1938, Tojo was recalled to Tokyo following the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War to serve as vice minister of the army, and in 1940 he was appointed minister of the army in the cabinet of Fumimaro Konoe. Tojo emerged as an outspoken advocate for a pre-emptive attack on the United States and its Western allies."", ""On Konoe's resignation, Tojo was appointed prime minister in October 1941. He oversaw Japan's decision to go to war with the Allies, its pre-emptive attack on Pearl Harbor and other U.S. and British possessions, and its ensuing conquest of much of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. During his tenure, Tojo presided over numerous war crimes, including the massacre and starvation of thousands of prisoners of war and millions of Asian civilians. From February 1944, Tojo concurrently served as the army's chief of staff. As the tide of war turned against Japan and after it was defeated at the Battle of Saipan, Tojo resigned as prime minister and chief of staff in July 1944. After Japan's surrender, he was arrested in September 1945 (during which he made a failed suicide attempt), convicted at the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal, and hanged in 1948."", ""Hideki Tojo was born in the Kōjimachi district of Tokyo on December 30, 1884,[2] as the third son of Hidenori Tojo, a lieutenant general in the Imperial Japanese Army.[3] Under the bakufu, Japanese society was divided rigidly into four castes; the merchants, artisans, peasants, and the samurai. After the Meiji Restoration, the caste system was abolished in 1871, but the former caste distinctions in many ways persisted afterwards, which ensured that those from the former samurai caste continued to enjoy their traditional prestige.[4] The Tojo family came from the samurai caste though the Tojos were relatively lowly warrior retainers for the great daimyō (lords) that they had served for generations.[5] Tojo's father was a samurai turned Army officer and his mother was the daughter of a Buddhist priest, making his family very respectable but poor.[4][6][7]"", 'Tojo had an education typical of Japanese youth in the Meiji era.[8] As a boy, Tojo was known for his stubbornness, lack of a sense of humor, and tenacious way of pursuing what he wanted.[9] He was an opinionated and combative youth who was fond of getting into fights with other boys. Japanese schools in the Meiji era were very competitive, and there was no tradition of sympathy for those who failed, and were often bullied by the teachers.[9] Those who knew him during his formative years deemed him to be of only average intelligence. However, he was known to compensate for his observed lack of intellect with a willingness to work extremely hard.[9] Tojo\'s boyhood hero was the 17th-century shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu who issued the injunction: ""Avoid the things you like, turn your attention to unpleasant duties.""[9] Tojo liked to say, ""I am just an ordinary man possessing no shining talents. Anything I have achieved I owe to my capacity for hard work and never giving up.""[9] In 1899, Tojo enrolled in the Army Cadet School.', ""In 1905, Tojo shared in the general outrage in Japan at the Treaty of Portsmouth, which ended the war with Russia and was seen by the Japanese people as a betrayal, as the war did not end with Japan annexing Siberia, which popular opinion had demanded.[10] The Treaty of Portsmouth was so unpopular that it set off anti-American riots known as the Hibiya incendiary incident, as many Japanese were enraged at the way the Americans had apparently cheated Japan as the Japanese gains in the treaty were far less than what public opinion had expected. Very few Japanese people at the time had understood that the war against Russia had pushed their nation to the verge of bankruptcy, and most people in Japan believed that the American president Theodore Roosevelt who had mediated the Treaty of Portsmouth had cheated Japan out of its rightful gains.[11] Tojo's anger at the Treaty of Portsmouth left him with an abiding dislike of Americans.[11] In 1909, he married Katsuko Ito, with whom he had three sons (Hidetake, Teruo, and Toshio) and four daughters (Mitsue, Makie, Sachie, and Kimie).[12][13]"", 'Upon graduating from the Japanese Military Academy (ranked 10th of 363 cadets)[14] in March 1905, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the infantry of the IJA. In 1918–19, he briefly served in Siberia as part of the Japanese expeditionary force sent to intervene in the Russian Civil War.[15] He served as a Japanese military attache to Germany between 1919 and 1922.[16] As the Imperial Japanese Army had been trained by a German military mission in the 19th century, the Japanese Army was always very strongly influenced by intellectual developments in the German Army, and Tojo was no exception.[17] In the 1920s, the German military favored preparing for the next war by creating a totalitarian Wehrstaat (Defense State), an idea that was taken up by the Japanese military as the ""national defense state."" In 1922, on his way home to Japan, he took a train ride across the United States, his first and only visit to North America, which left him with the impression that the Americans were a materialistic soft people devoted only to making money and to hedonistic pursuits like sex, partying, and (despite Prohibition) drinking.[18]', 'Tojo boasted that his only hobby was his work, and he customarily brought home his paperwork to work late into the night and refused to have any part in raising his children, which he viewed both as a distraction from his work and a woman\'s duty. He had his wife do all the work of taking care of his children.[19] A stern, humorless man, he was known for his brusque manner, his obsession with etiquette, and his coldness.[20] Like almost all Japanese officers at the time, he routinely slapped the faces of the men under his command when giving orders. He said that face-slapping was a ""means of training"" men who came from families that were not part of the samurai caste and for whom bushido was not second nature.[21]', 'In 1924, Tojo was greatly offended by the Immigration Control Act, which was passed by the US Congress. It banned all Asian immigration into the United States, with many representatives and senators openly saying the act was necessary because Asians worked harder than whites.[20] He wrote with bitterness at the time that American whites would never accept Asians as equals: ""It [the Immigration Control Act] shows how the strong will always put their own interests first. Japan, too, has to be strong to survive in the world.""[22]', 'By 1928, he was bureau chief of the Japanese Army and was shortly thereafter promoted to colonel. He began to take an interest in militarist politics during his command of the 8th Infantry Regiment. Reflecting the imagery often used in Japan to describe people in power, he told his officers that they were to be both a ""father"" and a ""mother"" to the men under their command.[21] Tojo often visited the homes of the men under his command, assisted his men with personal problems, and made loans to officers short of money.[23] Like many other Japanese officers, he disliked Western cultural influence in Japan, which was often disparaged as resulting in the ero guro nansensu (""eroticism, grotesquerie and nonsense"") movement as he complained about such forms of ""Western decadence"" like young couples holding hands and kissing in public, which were undermining traditional values necessary to uphold the kokutai.[24]', 'In 1934, Hideki was promoted to major general and served as chief of the personnel department within the Army Ministry.[25] Tojo wrote a chapter in the book Hijōji kokumin zenshū (Essays in time of national emergency), a book published in March 1934 by the Army Ministry calling for Japan to become a totalitarian ""national defense state"".[26] This book of fifteen essays by senior generals argued that Japan had defeated Russia in the war of 1904–05 because bushidō had given the Japanese superior willpower as the Japanese did not fear death unlike the Russians who wanted to live, and what was needed to win the inevitable next war (against precisely whom the book did not say) was to repeat the example of the Russian-Japanese war on a much greater scale by creating the ""national defense state"" to mobilize the entire nation for war.[26] In his essay, Tojo wrote ""The modern war of national defense extends over a great many areas"" requiring ""a state that can monolithically control"" all aspects of the nation in the political, social and economic spheres.[27] Tojo attacked Britain, France and the United States for waging ""ideological war"" against Japan since 1919.[28] Tojo ended his essay by stating that Japan must stand tall ""and spread its own moral principles to the world"" as the ""cultural and ideological war of the \'imperial way\' is about to begin"".[26]', 'Tojo was appointed commander of the IJA 24th Infantry Brigade in August 1934.[29] In September 1935, Tojo assumed top command of the Kempeitai of the Kwantung Army in Manchuria. Politically, he was nationalist, and militarist, and was nicknamed ""Razor"" (カミソリ, Kamisori), for his reputation of having a sharp and legalistic mind capable of quick decision-making. Tojo was a member of the Tōseiha (""Control Faction"") in the Army that was opposed by the more radical Kōdōha (""Imperial Way"") faction.[30] Both the Tōseiha and the Kōdōha factions were militaristic groups that favored a policy of expansionism abroad and dictatorship under the Emperor at home, but differed over the best way of achieving these goals.[30] The Imperial Way faction wanted a coup d\'état to achieve a Shōwa Restoration; emphasized ""spirit"" as the principal war-winning factor; and despite advocating socialist policies at home wanted to invade the Soviet Union.[30] The Control faction, while being willing to use assassination to achieve its goals, was more willing to work within the system to achieve reforms; wanted to create the ""national defense state"" to mobilize the entire nation before going to war and, while not rejecting the idea of ""spirit"" as a war-winning factor, also saw military modernization as a war-winning factor and the United States as a future enemy just as much as the Soviet Union.[30]', 'During the February 26 coup attempt of 1936, Tojo and Shigeru Honjō, a noted supporter of Sadao Araki, both opposed the rebels who were associated with the rival ""Imperial Way"" faction.[31] Emperor Hirohito himself was outraged at the attacks on his close advisors, and after a brief political crisis and stalling on the part of a sympathetic military, the rebels were forced to surrender. As the commander of the Kempeitai, Tojo ordered the arrest of all officers in the Kwantung Army suspected of supporting the coup attempt in Tokyo.[32] In the aftermath, the Tōseiha faction purged the Army of radical officers, and the coup leaders were tried and executed. After the purge, Tōseiha and Kōdōha elements were unified in their nationalist but highly anti-political stance under the banner of the Tōseiha military clique, which included Tojo as one of its leaders.', 'Tojo was promoted to chief of staff of the Kwantung Army in 1937.[33][34] As the ""Empire of Manchukuo"" was, in reality, a Japanese colony in all but name, the Kwangtung Army\'s duties were just as much political as they were military.[35] During this period, Tojo became close to Yōsuke Matsuoka, the fiery ultra-nationalist CEO of the South Manchuria Railway, one of Asia\'s largest corporations at the time, and Nobusuke Kishi, the Deputy Minister of Industry in Manchukuo, who was the man de facto in charge of Manchukuo\'s economy.[35] Though Tojo regarded preparing for a war against the Soviet Union as his first duty, Tojo also supported the forward policy in Northern China, as the Japanese sought to extend their influence into China.[35] As chief of staff, Tojo was responsible for the military operations designed to increase Japanese penetration into the Inner Mongolia border regions with Manchukuo. In July 1937, he personally led the units of the 1st Independent Mixed Brigade in Operation Chahar, his only real combat experience.[36]', 'After the Marco Polo Bridge Incident marking the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Tojo ordered his forces to attack Hebei Province and other targets in northern China. Tojo received Jewish refugees in accordance with Japanese national policy and rejected the resulting Nazi German protests.[37] Tojo was recalled to Japan in May 1938 to serve as vice-minister of the army under Army Minister Seishirō Itagaki.[38] From December 1938 to 1940, Tojo was Inspector-General of Army Aviation.[39]', 'On June 1, 1940, Emperor Hirohito appointed Kōichi Kido, a leading ""reform bureaucrat"" as the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, making him into the Emperor\'s leading political advisor and fixer.[40] Kido had aided in the creation in the 1930s of an alliance between the ""reform bureaucrats"" and the Army\'s ""Control"" faction centered on Tojo and General Mutō Akira. [40] Kido\'s appointment also favored the rise of his allies in the Control faction.[41] On July 30, 1940, Tojo was appointed army minister in the second Fumimaro Konoe regime and remained in that post in the third Konoe cabinet. Prince Konoe had chosen Tojo, a man representative of both the Army\'s hardline views and the Control faction with whom he was considered reasonable to deal, to secure the Army\'s backing for his foreign policy.[42] Tojo was a militant ultra-nationalist who was well respected for his work ethic and his ability to handle paperwork. Tojo upheld the wartime Japanese doctrine of the emperor as a living god, aligning his actions with imperial directives as part of his loyalty to the kokutai.[42] Konoe favored having Germany mediate an end to the Sino-Japanese War, pressured Britain to end its economic and military support of China even at the risk of war, sought better relations with both Germany and the United States, and took advantage of the changes in the international order caused by Germany\'s victories in the spring of 1940 to make Japan a stronger power in Asia.[43] Konoe wanted to make Japan the dominant power in East Asia, but he also believed it was possible to negotiate a modus vivendi with the United States under which the Americans would agree to recognize the ""Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere"".[43]', 'By 1940, Konoe, who had started the war with China in 1937, no longer believed that a military solution to the ""China Affair"" was possible and instead favored having Germany mediate an end to the war that would presumably result in a pro-Japanese peace settlement, but would be less than he himself had outlined in the ""Konoe programme"" of January 1938.[42] For this reason, Konoe wanted Tojo, a tough general whose ultra-nationalism was beyond question, to provide ""cover"" for his attempt to seek a diplomatic solution to the war with China.[42] Tojo was a strong supporter of the Tripartite Pact between Imperial Japan, Nazi Germany, and Fascist Italy. As the army minister, he continued to expand the war against China.[citation needed] After negotiations with Vichy France, Japan was given permission to place its troops in the southern part of French Indochina in July 1941. In spite of its formal recognition of the Vichy government, the United States retaliated against Japan by imposing economic sanctions in August, including a total embargo on oil and gasoline exports.[44] On September 6, a deadline of early October was fixed in the Imperial Conference for resolving the situation diplomatically. On October 14, the deadline had passed with no progress. Prime Minister Konoe then held his last cabinet meeting in which Tojo did most of the talking:', ""For the past six months, ever since April, the foreign minister has made painstaking efforts to adjust relations. Although I respect him for that, we remain deadlocked\xa0... The heart of the matter is the imposition on us of withdrawal from Indochina and China\xa0... If we yield to America's demands, it will destroy the fruits of the China incident. Manchukuo will be endangered and our control of Korea undermined.[45]"", 'The prevailing opinion within the Japanese Army at that time was that continued negotiations could be dangerous. However, Hirohito thought that he might be able to control extreme opinions in the army by using the charismatic and well-connected Tojo, who had expressed reservations regarding war with the West, but the emperor himself was sceptical that Tojo would be able to avoid conflict. On October 13, he declared to Kōichi Kido: ""There seems little hope in the present situation for the Japan-U.S. negotiations. This time, if hostilities erupt, I have to issue a declaration of war.""[46] During the last cabinet meetings of the Konoe government, Tojo emerged as a hawkish voice, saying he did not want a war with the United States but portrayed the Americans as arrogant, bullying, and white supremacists. He said that any compromise solution would only encourage them to make more extreme demands on Japan, in which case Japan might be better off choosing war to uphold national honor.[47] Despite saying he favored peace, Tojo had often declared at cabinet meetings that any withdrawal from French Indochina and/or China would be damaging to military morale and might threaten the kokutai; the ""China Incident"" could not be resolved via diplomacy and required a military solution; and attempting to compromise with the Americans would be seen as weakness by them.[48]', 'On October 16, Konoe, politically isolated and convinced that the emperor no longer trusted him, resigned. Later, he justified himself to his chief cabinet secretary, Kenji Tomita:', 'Of course His Majesty is a pacifist, and there is no doubt he wished to avoid war. When I told him that to initiate war is a mistake, he agreed. But the next day, he would tell me: ""You were worried about it yesterday, but you do not have to worry so much."" Thus, gradually, he began to lean toward war. And the next time I met him, he leaned even more toward war. In short, I felt the Emperor was telling me: ""My prime minister does not understand military matters, I know much more."" In short, the Emperor had absorbed the views of the army and navy high commands.[49]', 'At the time, Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni was said to be the only person who could control the Army and the Navy and was recommended by Konoe and Tojo as Konoe\'s replacement. Hirohito rejected this option, arguing that a member of the imperial family should not have to eventually carry the responsibility for a war against the West as a defeat would ruin the prestige of the House of Yamato.[50] Following the advice of Kōichi Kido, he chose instead Tojo, who was known for his devotion to the imperial institution.[50][51] By tradition, the Emperor needed a consensus among the elder statesmen or ""jushin"" before appointing a prime minister, and as long as former prime minister Admiral Keisuke Okada was opposed to Tojo, it would be impolitic for the Emperor to appoint him.[52] During the meetings of the jushin regarding Prince Konoe\'s succession, Okada argued against Tojo\'s appointment while the powerful Lord Privy Seal Kōichi Kido pushed for Tojo. The result was a compromise where Tojo would become prime minister while ""re-examining"" the options for dealing with the crisis with the United States, though no promise was made Tojo would attempt to avoid a war.[52]', 'After being informed of Tojo\'s appointment, Prince Takamatsu wrote in his diary: ""We have finally committed to war and now must do all we can to launch it powerfully. But we have clumsily telegraphed our intentions. We needn\'t have signaled what we\'re going to do; having [the entire Konoe cabinet] resign was too much. As matters stand now we can merely keep silent and without the least effort war will begin.""[53] Tojo\'s first speech on the radio made a call for ""world peace"", but also stated his determination to settle the ""China Affair"" on Japanese terms and to achieve the ""Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere"" that would unite all of the Asian nations together.[54]', 'The Emperor summoned Tojo to the Imperial Palace one day before Tojo took office.[50] After being informed of his appointment, Tojo was given one order from the Emperor: to make a policy review of what had been sanctioned by the Imperial Conferences.[52] Despite being vocally on the side of war, Tojo nevertheless accepted the order and pledged to obey. According to Colonel Akiho Ishii, a member of the Army General Staff, the newly appointed prime minister showed a true sense of loyalty to the emperor performing the duty. For example, when Ishii received from Hirohito a communication saying the Army should drop the idea of stationing troops in China to counter the military operations of the Western powers, he wrote a reply for Tojo for his audience with the Emperor. Tojo then replied to Ishii: ""If the Emperor said it should be so, then that\'s it for me. One cannot recite arguments to the Emperor. You may keep your finely phrased memorandum.""[55]', ""On November 2, Tojo and Chiefs of Staff Hajime Sugiyama and Osami Nagano reported to Hirohito that the review had been in vain. The Emperor then gave his consent to war.[56][57] The next day, Fleet Admiral Osami Nagano explained in detail the Pearl Harbor attack plan to Hirohito.[58] The eventual plan drawn up by Army and Navy Chiefs of Staff envisaged such a mauling of the Western powers that Japanese defense perimeter lines, operating on interior lines of communications and inflicting heavy Western casualties, could not be breached. In addition, the Japanese fleet which attacked Pearl Harbor was under orders from Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto to be prepared to return to Japan on a moment's notice, should negotiations succeed.[citation needed] Two days later, on November 5, Hirohito approved the operations plan for a war against the West and continued to hold meetings with the military and Tojo until the end of the month."", 'On November 26, 1941, US Secretary of State Cordell Hull handed Ambassador Nomura and Kurusu Saburo in Washington a ""draft mutual declaration of policy"" and ""Outline of Proposed Basis for Agreement between the United States and Japan.""[59] Hull proposed that Japan ""withdraw all military, naval, air and police forces"" from China and French Indochina in exchange for lifting the oil embargo, but left the term China undefined.[59] The ""Hull note,"" as it is known in Japan, made it clear the United States would not recognise the puppet government of Wang Jingwei as the government of China but strongly implied that the United States might recognise the ""Empire of Manchukuo""[opinion] and did not impose a deadline for the Japanese withdrawal from China.[59] On November 27, 1941, Tojo chose to misrepresent the ""Hull note"" to the Cabinet as an ""ultimatum to Japan,"" which was incorrect as it did not have a timeline for its acceptance and was marked ""tentative"" in the opening sentence, which is inconsistent with an ultimatum.[59] The claim that the Americans had demanded in the ""Hull note"" Japanese withdrawal from all of China, instead of just the parts that they had occupied since 1937, as well as the claim the note was an ultimatum, was used as one of the principal excuses for choosing war with the United States.[60] On December 1, another conference finally sanctioned the ""war against the United States, England, and the Netherlands.""[61]', 'On December 8, 1941 (December 7 in the Americas), Tojo went on Japanese radio to announce that Japan was now at war with the United States, the British Empire, and the Netherlands and read out an imperial rescript that ended with the playing of the martial song Umi Yukaba (Across the Sea), which set a war poem from the classic collection Manyōshū to music, featuring the lyrics ""Across the sea, corpses soaking in the water, Across the mountains corpses heaped up in the grass, We shall die by the side of our lord, We shall never look back"".[62] Tojo continued to hold the position of army minister during his term as prime minister from October 17, 1941, to July 22, 1944. He also served concurrently as home minister from 1941 to 1942, foreign minister in September 1942, education minister in 1943, and minister of Commerce and Industry in 1943. As education minister, he continued militaristic and nationalist indoctrination in the national education system and reaffirmed totalitarian policies in government.', 'In the early years of the war, Tojo had popular support as Japanese forces moved from one victory to another. In March 1942, in his capacity as army minister, he gave permission for the Japanese Army in Taiwan to ship 50 ""comfort women"" from Taiwan to Borneo without identification papers (his approval was necessary as Army rules forbade people without identification traveling to the new conquests).[63] The Japanese historian Yoshiaki Yoshimi noted the document proves that Tojo knew and approved of the ""comfort women"" corps.[63] On April 18, 1942, the Americans staged the Doolittle Raid, bombing Tokyo.[64] Some of the American planes were shot down and their pilots were taken prisoner.[64] The Army General Staff led by Field Marshal Hajime Sugiyama insisted on executing the eight American fliers but was opposed by Tojo, who feared that the Americans would retaliate against Japanese prisoners-of-war if the Doolittle fliers were executed.[64] The dispute was resolved by the emperor, who commuted the death sentences of five fliers but allowed the other three to die for reasons that remain unclear, as the documents relating to the emperor\'s intervention were burned in 1945.[64]', 'During Japan\'s initial successes in the war, Tojo and other Japanese leaders reportedly exhibited overconfidence, a phenomenon sometimes described as ""victory disease,"" as the entire elite was caught up in a state of hubris, believing Japan was invincible and the war was as good as won.[65] By May 1942, Tojo approved a set of ""non-negotiable"" demands to be presented once the Allies sued for peace that allowed Japan to keep everything it already conquered while assuming possession of considerably more. [65] Under such demands, Japan would assume control of the following territories:', 'Additionally, Tojo wanted all of China to be under the rule of the puppet Wang Jingwei and planned to buy Macau and East Timor from Portugal and create new puppet kingdoms in Burma, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaya.[66] As the Burmese had proved to be enthusiastic collaborators in the ""New Order in Asia,"" the new Burmese kingdom would be allowed to annex much of north-east India as a reward.[67] The Navy, for its part, demanded that Japan take New Caledonia, Fiji, and Samoa.[67]', 'While Tojo was prime minister, the main forum for military decision-making was the Imperial General Headquarters presided over by the Emperor. It consisted of the Army and Navy ministers; the Army and Navy chiefs of staff; and chiefs of the military affairs bureaus in both services.[68] The Imperial GHQ was not a joint chiefs of staff as existed in the United States and United Kingdom, but rather two separate services command operating under the same roof who would meet about twice a week to attempt to agree on a common strategy.[69] The Operations Bureaus of the Army and Navy would develop their own plans and then attempt to ""sell them"" to the other, which was often not possible.[70] Tojo was one voice out of many speaking at the Imperial GHQ, and was not able to impose his will on the Navy with which he had to negotiate as if he were dealing with an ally.[70] The American historian Stanley Falk described the Japanese system as characterized by ""bitter inter-service antagonisms"" as the Army and Navy worked ""at cross-purposes"", observing the Japanese system of command was ""uncoordinated, ill-defined and inefficient.""[71]', ""However, after the Battle of Midway, with the tide of war turning against Japan, Tojo faced increasing opposition within the government and military. In August–September 1942, a major crisis gripped the Tojo cabinet when Foreign Minister Shigenori Tōgō objected quite violently on August 29, 1942, to the Prime Minister's plan to establish a Greater East Asia Ministry to handle relations with the puppet regimes in Asia as an insult to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (the Gaimusho) and threatened to resign in protest.[72] Tojo went to see the Emperor, who backed the Prime Minister's plans for the Greater East Asia Ministry, and on September 1, 1942, Tojo told the cabinet he was establishing the Greater East Asia Ministry and could not care less about how the Gaimusho felt about the issue, which led Tōgō to resign in protest.[72]"", 'The American historian Herbert Bix wrote that Tojo was a ""dictator"" only in the narrow sense that from September 1942 on, he was generally able to impose his will on the Cabinet without seeking a consensus, but at the same time noted that Tojo\'s authority was based upon the support of the Emperor, who held ultimate power.[72] In November 1942, Tojo, as Army Minister, was involved in drafting the regulations for taking ""comfort women"" from China, Japan (which included Taiwan and Korea at this time) and Manchukuo to the ""South"", as the Japanese called their conquests in South-East Asia, to ensure that the ""comfort women"" had the proper papers before departing. Until then the War Ministry required special permission to take ""comfort women"" without papers, and Tojo was tired of dealing with these requests.[73] At the same time, Tojo, as the Army Minister, became involved in a clash with the Army chief of staff over whether to continue the battle of Guadalcanal or not. Tojo sacked the Operations office and his deputy at the general staff, who were opposed to withdrawing, and ordered the abandonment of the island.[74]', 'In September 1943, the Emperor and Tojo agreed that Japan would pull back to an ""absolute defense line"" in the southwest Pacific to stem the American advance, and considered abandoning Rabaul base, but changed their minds in the face of objections from the Navy.[75] In November 1943, the American public\'s reaction to the Battle of Tarawa led Tojo to view Tarawa as a sort of Japanese victory, believing that more battles like Tarawa would break American morale, and force the U.S. to sue for peace.[76] Moreover, Tojo believed that the Americans would become bogged down in the Marshalls, giving more time to strengthen the defenses in the Marianas.[76] In late 1943, with the support of the Emperor, Tojo made a major effort to make peace with China to free up the 2 million Japanese soldiers in China for operations elsewhere, but the unwillingness of the Japanese to give up any of their ""rights and interests"" in China doomed the effort.[77] China was by far the largest theater of operations for Japan, and with the Americans steadily advancing in the Pacific, Tojo was anxious to end the quagmire of the ""China affair"" to redeploy Japanese forces.[77] In an attempt to enlist support from all of Asia, especially China, Tojo opened the Greater East Asia Conference in November 1943, which issued a set of Pan-Asian war aims, which made little impression on most Asians.[78] On January 9, 1944, Japan signed a treaty with the puppet Wang regime under which Japan gave up its extraterritorial rights in China as part of a bid to win Chinese public opinion over to a pro-Japanese viewpoint, but as the treaty changed nothing in practice, the gambit failed.[79]', 'At the same time as he sought a diplomatic effort to end the war with China, Tojo also approved of the planning for Operation Ichi-Go, a huge offensive against China intended to take the American air bases in China and finally knock China out of the war once and for all.[80] In January 1944, Tojo approved orders issued by Imperial General Headquarters for an invasion of India, where the Burma Area Army in Burma under General Masakazu Kawabe was to seize the Manipour and Assam provinces with the aim of cutting off American aid to China (the railroad that supplied the American air bases in north-east India that allowed for supplies to be flown over ""the Hump"" of the Himalayas to China passed through these provinces).[81] Cutting off American aid to China in turn might have had the effect of forcing Chiang Kai-shek to sue for peace. Following the 15th Army into India in the U-Go offensive were the Indian nationalist Subhas Chandra Bose and his Indian National Army, as the political purpose of the operation was to provoke a general uprising against British rule in India that might allow the Japanese to take all of India.[82] The roads necessary to properly supply the 150,000 Japanese soldiers committed to invading India would turn into mud when the monsoons arrived, giving the Japanese a very short period of time to break through. The Japanese were counting on capturing food from the British to feed their army, assuming that all of India would rise up when the Japanese arrived and thereby cause the collapse of the Raj.[83][84] The Japanese brought along with them enough food to last for only 20 days; after that, they would have to capture food from the British to avoid starving.[85] Bose had impressed Tojo at their meetings as the best man to inspire an anti-British revolution in India.[82]', 'In the central Pacific, the Americans destroyed the main Japanese naval base at Truk in an air raid on February 18, 1944, forcing the Imperial Navy back to the Marianas (the oil to fuel ships and planes operating in the Marshalls, Caroline and Gilbert islands went up in smoke at Truk).[86] This breach of the ""absolute defense line"", five months after its creation, led Tojo to fire Admiral Osami Nagano as the Navy Chief of Staff, for incompetence.[87] The Americans had penetrated 2,100\xa0km (1,300 miles) beyond the ""absolute defense line"" at Truk, and Tojo, senior generals and admirals all blamed each other for the situation.[76] To strengthen his position in the face of criticism of the way the war was going, on February 21, 1944, Tojo assumed the post of Chief of the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff, arguing he needed to take personal charge of the Army.[86] When Field Marshal Sugiyama complained to the Emperor about being fired and having the Prime Minister run the General Staff, the Emperor told him he supported Tojo.[86] Tojo\'s major concern as Army Chief of Staff was planning the operations in China and India, with less time given over to the coming battles in the Marianas.[88] Tojo decided to take the strategic offensive for 1944 with his plans to win the war in 1944 being as follows:', 'Tojo expected that a major American defeat in the Marianas combined with the conquest of China and India would so stun the Americans that they would sue for peace.[76] By this point, Tojo no longer believed the war aims of 1942 could be achieved, but he believed that his plans for victory in 1944 would lead to a compromise peace that he could present as a victory to the Japanese people.[76] By serving as prime minister, Army Minister and Army Chief of Staff, Tojo took on nearly all of the responsibility; if plans for victory in 1944 failed, he would have no scapegoat.[88]', ""On March 12, 1944, the Japanese launched the U-Go offensive and invaded India.[83] Tojo had some doubts about Operation U-Go, but it was ordered by the Emperor himself, and Tojo was unwilling to oppose any decision of the Emperor.[90] Despite the Japanese Pan-Asian rhetoric and claim to be liberating India, the Indian people did not revolt and the Indian soldiers of the 14th Army stayed loyal to their British officers, and the invasion of India ended in complete disaster.[83] The Japanese were defeated by the Anglo-Indian 14th Army at the Battles of Imphal and Kohima. On July 5, 1944, the Emperor accepted Tojo's advice to end the invasion of India as 72,000 Japanese soldiers had been killed in battle. A similar number had starved to death or died of diseases as the logistics to support an invasion of India were lacking, once the monsoons turned the roads of Burma into impassable mud.[90] Of the 150,000 Japanese soldiers who had participated in the March invasion of India, most were dead by July 1944.[91]"", 'In parallel with the invasion of India, in April 1944 Tojo began Operation Ichigo, the largest Japanese offensive of the entire war, with the aim of taking southern China.[80]', 'In the Battle of Saipan, about 70,000 Japanese soldiers, sailors, and civilians were killed in June–July 1944 and in the Battle of the Philippine Sea the Imperial Navy suffered a crushing defeat.[92] The first day of the Battle of the Philippine Sea, June 19, 1944, was dubbed by the Americans ""the Great Marianas Turkey Shoot"", as over the course of the dogfights in the air, the US Navy lost 30 planes while shooting down about 350 Imperial Japanese planes, in one of the Imperial Navy\'s most humiliating defeats.[93] The Japanese believed that indoctrination in bushido (""the way of the warrior"") would give them the edge as the Japanese longed to die for the Emperor, while the Americans were afraid to die, but superior American pilot training and airplanes meant the Japanese were hopelessly outclassed by the Americans.[93] With Saipan in American hands, the Americans could take other islands in the Marianas to build airbases.[94] The establishment of American bases in the Marianas meant the cities of Japan were within the range of B-29 Superfortress bombers and the British historian H. P. Willmott noted that ""even the most hard-headed of the Japanese militarists could dimly perceive that Japan would be at the end of her tether in that case"".[94] As the news of the disastrous defeat suffered at Saipan reached Japan, it turned elite opinion against the Tojo government.[92] The Emperor himself was furious about the defeat at Saipan; had called a meeting of the Board of Field Marshals and Fleet Admirals to consider whether it might be possible to recapture Saipan; and Prince Takamatsu wrote in his diary ""he flares up frequently"".[95] Tojo was the prime minister, minister of the army and chief of the army general staff, and was seen both in Japan and in the US as, in the words of Willmott, ""the embodiment of national determination, hardline nationalism and militarism"".[92] Prince Konoe and Admiral Okada had been plotting to bring down the Tojo government since the spring of 1943, and their principal problem had been the support of the Emperor, who did not wish to lose his favorite prime minister.[96]', 'After the Battle of Saipan, it was clear to at least some of the Japanese elite that the war was lost, and Japan needed to make peace before the kokutai and perhaps even the Chrysanthemum Throne itself was destroyed.[92] Tojo had been so demonized in the United States during the war that, for the American people, Tojo was the face of Japanese militarism, and it was inconceivable that the United States would make peace with a government headed by Tojo.[92] Willmott noted that an additional problem for the ""peace faction"" was that: ""Tojo was an embodiment of \'mainstream opinion\' within the nation, the armed services and particularly the Army. Tojo had powerful support, and by Japanese standards, he was not extreme.""[97] Tojo was more of a follower than a leader, and he represented mainstream opinion in the Army, and so his removal from office would not mean the end of the political ambitions of an Army still fanatically committed to victory or death.[92] The jushin (elder statesmen) had advised the Emperor that Tojo needed to go after Saipan and further advised the Emperor against partial changes in the cabinet, demanding that the entire Tojo cabinet resign.[98] Tojo, aware of the intrigues to bring him down, had sought the public approval of the Emperor, which was denied; the Emperor sent him a message to the effect that the man responsible for the disaster of Saipan was not worthy of his approval.[98] Tojo suggested reorganizing his cabinet to regain Imperial approval, but was rebuffed again; the Emperor said the entire cabinet had to go.[98] Once it was clear that Tojo no longer had the support of the Chrysanthemum Throne, Tojo\'s enemies had little trouble bringing down his government.[96] The politically powerful Lord Privy Seal, Marquis Kōichi Kido spread the word that the Emperor no longer supported Tojo.[96] After the fall of Saipan, he was forced to resign on July 18, 1944.[98]', 'As Tojo\'s replacement, the jushin advised the Emperor to appoint a former prime minister, Admiral Mitsumasa Yonai, as he was popular among the Navy, the diplomatic corps, the bureaucracy and the ""peace faction"". However, Yonai refused to serve, fearing that a prime minister who attempted to make peace with the Americans might be assassinated, as many Army officers were still committed to victory or death and regarded any talk of peace as treason.[98] He stated that only another general could serve as prime minister, and recommended General Kuniaki Koiso in his place.[98] At a conference with the Emperor, Koiso and Yonai were told to co-operate in forming a new government, but not told which of them was to become prime minister.[98] As the Emperor was worshiped as a living god, neither man felt able to directly ask him who was to take the position.[98] Lord Privy Seal Kido resolved the confusion by declaring that Koiso was the prime minister.[98] Two days after Tojo resigned, the Emperor gave him an imperial rescript offering him unusually lavish praise for his ""meritorious services and hard work"" and declaring ""Hereafter we expect you to live up to our trust and make even greater contributions to military affairs"".[96]', ""After Japan's unconditional surrender in 1945, U.S. general Douglas MacArthur ordered the arrest of forty individuals suspected of war crimes, including Tojo. Five American GIs were sent to serve the arrest warrant.[99] As American soldiers surrounded Tojo's house on September 11, he shot himself in the chest with a pistol, but missed his heart. As a result of this experience, the Army had medical personnel present during the later arrests of other accused Japanese war criminals, such as Shigetarō Shimada."", 'As he bled, Tojo began to talk, and two Japanese reporters recorded his words: ""I am very sorry it is taking me so long to die. The Greater East Asia War was justified and righteous. I am very sorry for the nation and all the races of the Greater Asiatic powers. I wait for the righteous judgment of history. I wished to commit suicide but sometimes that fails.""[100]', ""After recovering from his injuries, Tojo was moved to Sugamo Prison. During his imprisonment, Tojo received a new set of dentures, reportedly engraved with 'Remember Pearl Harbor' in Morse code by an American dentist, a claim that has since been a subject of historical curiosity.[101] The dentist ground away the message three months later.[102]"", 'Tojo was tried by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East for war crimes and found guilty of, among other actions,[103] waging wars of aggression; war in violation of international law; unprovoked or aggressive war against various nations; and ordering, authorizing, and permitting inhumane treatment of prisoners of war.[6][104][105]', ""Crimes committed by Imperial Japan were responsible for the deaths of millions (some estimate between 3 million[106] and 14 million[107]) of civilians and prisoners of war through massacre, human experimentation, starvation, and forced labor that was either directly perpetrated or condoned by the Japanese military and government with a significant portion of them occurring during Tojo's rule of the military.[108][109][110][111][112] One source[who?] attributes 5 million civilian deaths to Tojo's rule of the military."", 'Tojo accepted full responsibility for his actions during the war and made this speech:', ""It is natural that I should bear entire responsibility for the war in general, and, needless to say, I am prepared to do so. Consequently, now that the war has been lost, it is presumably necessary that I be judged so that the circumstances of the time can be clarified and the future peace of the world be assured. Therefore, with respect to my trial, it is my intention to speak frankly, according to my recollection, even though when the vanquished stands before the victor, who has over him the power of life and death, he may be apt to toady and flatter. I mean to pay considerable attention to this in my actions, and say to the end that what is true is true and what is false is false.

His leadership was marked by widespread state violence perpetrated in the name of Japanese nationalism and imperialism; after the war, he was convicted as a war criminal and executed. Tojo's legacy remains firmly intertwined with the Empire of Japan's wars of aggression and numerous atrocities.","This article provides an overview of Hideki Tojo, the former Prime Minister of Japan who served as the leader of the country during World War II. Here are some key points about Tojo's life and legacy:

**War Crimes Trials**

Tojo was sentenced to death for war crimes committed by the Japanese military, particularly for his role in the atrocities committed against civilians, including the Nanking Massacre. He apologized for these actions before his execution.

**Execution and Burial**

Tojo was executed by hanging on December 23, 1948, just a week after his trial. His body was cremated, but his ashes were scattered over the Pacific Ocean to prevent them from being used as war trophies.

**Historical Controversies**

The trial of Tojo has been marred by controversy over the handling of Emperor Hirohito and other members of the imperial family. The US Army's General Douglas MacArthur and Brigadier General Bonner Fellers were accused of working to exonerate the Emperor and shift responsibility to Tojo.

**Legacy in Japan**

Tojo is widely regarded as a national hero in Japan, despite his involvement in World War II atrocities. Some historians have criticized the handling of Tojo's trial and execution by MacArthur and Fellers, arguing that it was an attempt to whitewash Hirohito and the imperial family.

**Legacy in China**

Tojo is also widely despised in China, where he is often cited as a symbol of Japanese aggression and militarism. In 1997, a survey of university students in China found that Tojo was the person most associated with Japan.

**Film Portrayal**

Tojo has been portrayed in several films, including the 1998 Japanese film ""Pride,"" which depicts him as a national hero forced into war by the West and executed after a rigged trial. However, this portrayal is widely criticized for its revisionist take on Tojo's legacy.
