internet - the possibilities, democracy and life-transformation

One of the central symbols of this age was Wikipedia, an online encyclopedia created by the users. Curated by volunteers, it was a common good everybody could take from and contribute to, as long as they followed community guidelines.

# wiki intro

since 2001, but the idea is dates much back.

Rick Gates in 1993. an advocate for open knowledge, even in the pre-internet era.

The other guy here Richart Stallman
the idea of "free" (not as in "zero-price", but as in "freedom")
the "copyleft" licenses.
in 1998 the concept of a free-as-in-freedom online encyclopedia (as opposed to merely open source).
concept specifically included the idea that no central organization should control editing.

Automatic software, which I will refer to as bots here, helped to expand wikipedia in quantitative means from its early stages.

- every missing county, town, city, and village in the United States, based on free information from the

The other case is even more interesting. Who has heard about Cebuano language?
I certainly didn't until recently. Little did I know - it is the second biggest of the all wikipedia language projects!

# Cebuano

- Austronesian, southern
- second most spoken
- very few active users
- second largest Wikipedia with over 6,116,937 articles
- most of its content (circa 99%) was created by bots, automatic programs, most notably

  > Cebuano Wikipedia does not appear to be widely used in the Philippines; as of March 2021, 90 percent of Wikipedia views from that country were directed at English Wikipedia, with 5 percent going to Tagalog and 3 percent to Russian Wikipedia. About 30 percent of Cebuano Wikipedia views come from China, 22 percent from the United States, and only about 11 percent from the Philippines (roughly the same number as from France).

# Ljsbot

- uses remote databases and websites and compiles them to article
- up to 10,000 articles per day
- author of milion-th article in Swedish wikipedia, which made it the second largest wiki project, over 8% of all wikipedia content in 2014
- Sverker Johanson,

- stubs seem innocent, help to map the known

- criticised for "lack of human touch" and little meaningful content.

  > Johansson countered attacks on his methods by appealing to problems of gender bias on Wikipedia, noting that if the bot does not write articles, "otherwise they're mainly written by young, white, male nerds and reflect male interests.

it is an easy prey

- wikipedia is open, meaning anyone can edit articles

But, more over, it is very tasty treat. Many of the reasons why you can guess yourselves - it is just sooo popular.

# croatian case

project capture, meaning not a certain article nor discussion, but a whole language wiki project has been overtaken
The editors, who seemed to know each other personally and sharing same political sentiments coordinated and moved strategicly

throughtout a decade, altered or even re-written hundreds of articles on country's history, politics and many other topics
involving right-wing, ultra-conservatist bias to the content

**context**

- Serbo-Croatian Wikipedia’s community was split up into Croatian, Bosnian, Serbian, and the original
  Serbo-Croatian wikis starting in 2003. Although speaking the same language (and perhaps writing it with different scripts), the articles content started to diverge apart, with HR ones taking on a very specific narrative.

distorted the content (...), abused power, and systematically obstructed otherwise
accepted global Wikipedia community practices (...) through sock-puppeting (...) - using inauthentic online identities for the purpose of deception.

it would soon a) branch out from the original topic; b) turn ad hominem; and c) become flooded with irrelevant comments and information.

disinformation and bias

**bias**
by using well-known disinformation tactics, including
relativisation of facts, whataboutism, discreditation of other participants and outright bullying

Framing bias: Also known as emulated neutrality.

Source bias: Citing non-neutral sources without disclosing their affiliation

Selection bias: Selectively including and excluding content regardless of its notability
or topical relevance in order to affect the reader’s perception.

The evaluation has shown that Croatian and Serbian language Wikipedia, in 62.5% and 39.1% of
cases, respectively, avoid informing their visitors in the introductory paragraph that the person
they’re reading about is a convicted war criminal who comes from the same ethnic group. (Google Knowledge Panel)

- Whitewashing "our people" was a standard
- introducing dismissive / political labels as actual encyclopedia entries

**governance**
Administrators and sock-puppeteers
The group has been using its on-wiki positions of power to attract new like-minded contributors, silence and ban dissenters, manipulate community elections and subvert Wikipedia’s and the broader movement’s native conflict resolution mechanisms.

Very active in discussions, but going silent in crucial moments to avoid detection

**results**

- decade of Political revisionism and manipulation of facts in WikiHR.
- youth - Youth are the main consumers of social media and the main target of misinformation campaigns.

Google’s Knowledge Panel

For it to work, you need a lot of editions and a long period of time.

**as an example**
threre could be similar attempts of project capture in other languages as well.
A more resourced and better-organized attempt could be harder to detect and eventually reverse.
Wikipedia is pretty resilent against the pressures from autocratic regimes, but not from taking the project from within

**detection**
The report analysed articles of 32 widely known people from the time and compared the way their biographies are shown.

Identifying disinformation, which usually entails demonstrating intent, on Wikipedia as such is substantially more difficult.

certain bias in how how some facts are contextualized within wiki projects is unavoidable and part of platform's genome
At the same time,

> bias is usually found, discussed and ultimately corrected by the Wikipedia volunteer communities.
> If may of these biased facts stay on and do not get corrected, it stops being NPOV and contributes to represetation of facts that is part of disinformation campaign

One of solutioons suggested within the report was "developing collaborative solutions that would help monitor communities globally to timely identify major ideological shifts in projects."

# what can be done?

With hundeds of thousands of edits daily, there is simply not enough trained volunteers to be able to assess the incoming tsunami of content
a set of ML utils to help quickly assess drafts, articles and revisions

Most of them have been part of ORES (Objective Revision Evaluation Service),
Here we see a typical flow in case of revisions. A constant flow of edits comes in here and each gets asssinged one of three available labels.
