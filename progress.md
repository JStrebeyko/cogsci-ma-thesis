reading: [Research:Interpolating quality dynamics in Wikipedia and demonstrating the Keilana Effect](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Interpolating_quality_dynamics_in_Wikipedia_and_demonstrating_the_Keilana_Effect)

- interesting, a model for assessing article quality using "actionable metrics" is pretty ok in assessing article class. Cool references, found one similar
  written to a friend to suggest someone from [ZIL PAN](https://zil.ipipan.waw.pl/), two of their research interests fall close to the subject: sentiment analysis and
  credibility assessment of online content

### 8.11

- check access to ORES

  - checked, it became one of many models available at LeftWing. The problem is the API expects existing revisions and not arbitrary data, making it difficult to use with a made up dataset;

### 10.11

- reachout: [EDMO](https://edmo.eu/), [DEMAGOG](https://demagog.org.pl/), [SWPS](https://swps.pl/kontakt/nauka-i-badania/);
- write to the promotor;
- set a meeting with P.Przybyła;

### 11.11

- went go through arxiv on two queries: "bias detection llms" and "wikipedia llms"

Yet another 20 articles to read, with at least 2 seemingly very relevant

### 12.11

investigate the edits quantitatively: get number per date and plot, reach to article content before / after
read two most relevant articles, inc. the wiki npov / llm article (too relevant to postpone)

- early results: LLMs are very bad at detecting biased text (~61%, a little more than a coinflip)
  prepared a little presentation for tomorrow

### 13.11

meet with PP. The [notes are here](./reachout/13.11.md) (in PL)

important possible shortcomings of the current direction:

- seeking intention, which is classically very difficult;
- seems like a pretty complex expertise knowledge is needed, something LLMs out of the box do not have, and which would be necessary for zero / few shot.
- to fine-tune we would need few tousands labeled examples. the endavour would necessitate countless hours and shouldn't be performed by a single person by definition
- PP pretty optimistic about the pivot, modelling the "heatmap" of the most commonly changes parts of the article
